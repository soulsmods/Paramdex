1000000 (Guha!)
1000001 (Gu ... ga ...)
1000002 You fought for me
1000003 Is it possible to throw it away?
1000004 Wolf, live with my blood ...
1000100 Father ... Mother ...
1000101 Butterflies ... Where did everyone go ...
1000102 Son
1000103 ... is it illusion?
1000104 (U ...)
1000105 It&#39;s been a long time
1000106 Owl
1000107 Butterfly hall ...
1000108 Please go
1000109 You ... is ...
1000110 Do what you need to do
1000111 …I understand
1000112 Well, let&#39;s do it
1100000 (Hmm ...!?)
1100001 is this…
1100002 You seem to have awakened
1100003 Apparently, it&#39;s not decided to die yet
1100100 Close your eyes and listen to the bell
1100101 The sound of that bell will awaken
1100102 I&#39;m asleep, your old memory
1100200 Goho ... Goho ...
1100201 Uuu…
1100202 Hmm ... you ... it looks like you&#39;re awake
1100203 Causal
1100204 You can&#39;t die easily
1101000 How is your grandfather?
1101001 Isshin-sama ... It&#39;s strange that he keeps his life.
1101002 …Really
1101003 Son, say it again
1101004 Make a promise of immortality with me
1101005 I can&#39;t do it, Genichiro
1101006 Even if you lose once
1101007 Bet your life and be sure to regain the Lord
1101008 If it becomes my shinobi
1101009 I came to pick you up
1101010 Now for a while
1101011 Please wait
1101012 got it…
1101013 As long as you don&#39;t kill you
1101014 It seems that I can&#39;t get the dragon seed
1101100 It ’s wonderful ...
1101101 Regrettable
1101102 Are you going to change the Lord?
1101103 Junk
1101104 If it&#39;s a joke ...?
1101105 If I want to protect this reed name
1101106 Whatever heretical power
1101107 Show me
1101108 Tomoe&#39;s thunder, let&#39;s show you
1101200 You ... won
1101201 Lord ...
1101202 I&#39;m not going to fight
1101203 Shinobi of the Son ... (!)
1101204 Genichiro-dono, what if weird young water ...
1101205 Ashina, this country is all about me
1101206 For that reason I
1101207 Let&#39;s stop humans
1101208 Returning from the dead
1101209 Oh……
1101210 Farewell…!
1101300 I remember you well
1101301 I heard you&#39;re dead, but what on earth are you planning?
1101302 Owl
1101303 There is also a demise, such as plotting
1101304 Let&#39;s come with me
1101305 This owl is the precious blood of your child
1101306 I just want to protect it
1101307 Was the Lord also fascinated by the dragon seed?
1101308 Never talk
1101309 Good to leave
1101310 I&#39;m sorry
1101311 I want to enjoy this nostalgic view for a while
1101312 When I&#39;m satisfied, I&#39;ll go home
1101400 (Uuu ...) I&#39;m ...
1101401 Why don&#39;t you understand this father&#39;s feelings
1101402 Did you forget the rules of ninja?
1101403 The rules are set by myself
1101404 I decided so
1101405 Like my lord ...
1101406 HM…
1101407 Seems to be growing a little
1101408 Let&#39;s do it
1101409 Wolf
1101500 Ship wolf
1101501 Lord, I don&#39;t have any amiability ...
1101502 It was a strange and unhateable guy
1101503 (Huh ...)
1101504 here we go
1101505 Let&#39;s slash before falling into Shura
1101600 That ’s why
1101601 With this, my supremacy is also ...
1101602 (... Nu !?)
1101603 This is a noisy customer
1101604 However, fighting with Dogen-den&#39;s daughter
1101605 I&#39;m sorry for the late one ...
1101606 I can&#39;t stand!
1101607 cheek…!
1101608 … Why?
1101609 Wolf, leave it to you
1101610 Defeat it brilliantly
1101611 Yuyi
1101612 I once saw Shura
1101613 There is the same thing in you
1101614 I have to cut it
1101700 ... I made you wait
1101701 However, this success is also good
1101702 However, even though he is old
1101703 As expected
1101704 This is all in my hands
1101705 Reeds and Uchifu
1101706 I&#39;ll eat this country!
1101707 Me, Hakai right and left...
1101708 (Guh!)
1101709 (U ... gu ...)
1101710 Nah ...
1101711 Why are you ...
1101712 (...!) Shura ...!
1101713 (Hahhh ...)
1101714 ... No, you ...
1101715 You are not Shura ...
1101716 … Thousands of dead, including soldiers and folk grass
1101717 Almost no survival
1101718 Ashina became the stage of the most tragic murder in the Warring States period
1101719 It is said that demons lurked in that area until later ...
1101800 Uh ...
1101801 … Already good, wolf
1101900 The dragon seed of the length is also ...
1101901 Live with you
1101902 I will receive it
1101903 Umu
1101904 ………
1101905 You can open your eyes
1101906 Is ...
1101800 &quot;S11_01_0070_Ending 4_Shura End&quot;
1101801 ・ Betray the prince and kill the chief of the Ninja army, the main character ・ Become a demon and involve Ashina in the whirlpool of war, ending on the path of Shura
1102000 (Huh!)
1102001 (Gah ... ha ...)
1102002 Stealth, is this about this?
1102003 Your child will get it
1102100 And more than 20 years since the one-hearted country theft
1102101 The country of reeds is in the sun
1102102 The wolf ninja has lost everything
1102103 The father-in-law who raised him and the Lord who should protect him ...
1102104 Steal
1102105 Please wake up
1102106 For your Lord
1102200 (That!)
1102201 … Well, he came
1102202 It&#39;s been a long time, wolf
1102203 I came to pick you up, my lord
1102204 … Umm
1102205 Raise the face
1102206 Wedge Maru, your sword
1102207 Stealth of me
1102208 According to master-slave contract
1102209 Bet your life and serve me
1102210 Yuyi
1102300 (Huh)
1102301 Wolf, you found me well
1102302 Let&#39;s come
1102303 Yuyi
1102304 From the blood stipulation
1102305 You can only escape ...
1102400 It&#39;s been a long time, my son
1102401 Since before my uncle&#39;s grave
1102402 Genichiro-dono ...
1102403 I…
1102404 ... I&#39;m sorry
1102405 Leave it to me
1102406 Get in the way or steal your son
1102500 (Guha ...)
1102501 ... I couldn&#39;t do anything after all
1102502 But ...
1102503 Dragon seed saves this country
1102504 With this, the night of Ashina is over
1102505 (Mu ...)
1102506 My merciful grandson ...
1102507 The last wish
1102508 I have to return this reed name to Yomi
1102509 Therefore, the ship wolf ...
1102510 I&#39;ll kill the Lord
1102600 (Hah, ha, ha ...)
1102601 Kuro-sama!
1102602 It&#39;s been a long time, my son&#39;s ninja
1102603 Behold, another swing of immortality
1102604 Genichiro-dono ...
1102605 In such a thing, the fate of Ashina is never ...
1102606 Do not change
1102607 Wolf
1102608 It shouldn&#39;t be in anyone&#39;s hands, such as a dragon seed.
1102609 … Don&#39;t worry
1102610 Yuyi
1102611 ...... Come
1102612 Oh, let&#39;s finish
1102700 Oh ... no ...
1102701 (What !?)
1102702 Stealth, don&#39;t call it cowardly
1102703 Your child will get it
1102800 Where ... then ... the wolf ...
1102801 I&#39;m on your side
1102802 ... the tears of a dragon
1102803 (Kokuri ...)
1102804 Stealth of my life
1102805 Can you please cut off immortality?
1102806 You still have this
1102807 Also, a new ninja
1102808 It&#39;s time to ask for power
1102900 Where ... then ... the wolf ...
1102901 I&#39;m on your side
1102902 ... the tears of a dragon
1102903 (Kokuri ...)
1102904 (U ... gu ...)
1102905 Defeat the last immortality
1102906 Live as a person
1102907 You can go
1102908 Okay
1102909 I also live hard as a person
1102910 And I think I&#39;ll die
1102911 Like my ninja did that ...
1102912 Thank you to Emma
1103000 Where ... then ... the wolf ...
1103001 I&#39;m on your side
1103002 ... the tears of a dragon
1103003 (Kokuri ...)
1103004 (Soo ... Soo ... Soo ...)
1103005 Let&#39;s visit, my son
1103006 Kuro, please be at ease now
1103007 Stay in my heart
1103008 Goodbye everyone
1103009 I have to go
1103010 To cut off our cause and effect
1103011 It will be a very long journey
1103012 Will you still come with me?
1103013 Okay
1103014 Thank you. Dragon stealth
1103015 Kuro-dono is also pleased
1103016 … Let&#39;s visit
1103017 To the west. In the hometown of the god dragon ...
1500000 Is it the palace of the source?
2000000 Three monkeys ...
2000001 One is empty
2000002 Nu ...
2000100 Please forgive me
2000101 They just tried to protect me
2000102 But that doesn&#39;t seem to come true
2000103 Please close your eyes
2000104 See you at Oku-no-in
2000200 If you are prepared
2000201 Change
2000202 (Gut ...!)
2000203 Why are everyone willing to die ...
2000204 (What !?)
2000205 Oh, you are ...! ??
2000206 That right eye ...
2000207 You&#39;re receiving the curse of the dragon
2000208 Immortal slash
2000209 surely…
2000210 Received
2000300 This cherry blossom drop ...
2000301 Please help you
2000302 Let&#39;s go
2000303 Okay
2000304 ………
2000305 It&#39;s okay to open your eyes
2000306 Do you get it
2500000 ... Senkyo?
2500100 Dragon God
2500101 I&#39;m afraid
6000000 three years ago
6000001 Yeyue 9th, 5th year of Wenluo
6000010 Date display (castle past)
7000000 You seem to have awakened
7000001 Apparently, it&#39;s not decided to die yet
7000002 It&#39;s been a long time since I picked you up ...
7000003 The Lord of Nushi is still alive
7000004 However, that bloodline will soon be used.
7000005 It&#39;s a shinobi
7000006 For the wolf on the arm, it ’s a custom-made fang.
7000007 … But it&#39;s causal. You can&#39;t die easily
8000000 Time is the end of the Warring States period
8000001 The war that burned all of Japan
8000002 Still unabated
8000003 In the mountainous country of reeds
8000004 It was burning
8000005 (Hah, huh ...) * Several types
8000006 (Huh, ah ...) * Several types
8000007 (Hi) * Several types

8000022 (Mmm! Oh! What the hell!)
8000023 … The battle is over
8000024 Isshin-sama ...
8000025 (Mmm! Oh! What&#39;s wrong!) * Several types
8000026 (Nuu! Muoh! Gunuu!) * Several types
8000027 (Oh oh! Oh oh!) * Several types
8000028 (I&#39;m going!)
8000029 (There is a chance!)
8000030 (There is a country samurai!)
8000031 (There is a fool!)
8000032 (I&#39;m sorry!)
8000033 (Crush!)
8000034 (Guwaa! Guuu! Ugh!) * Several types
8000035 What a terrifying man ...
8000036 Does the reed name have a demon?
8000037 Steal the country or do your best ...
8000038 (Mmm! Oh! What&#39;s wrong!) * Several types
8000039 (Nuu! Muoh! Gunuu!) * Several types
8000040 (Oh oh! Oh oh!) * Several types
8000041 Let&#39;s go!
8000042 There is a chance!
8000043 It&#39;s a reed name!
8000044 Tamura Ah!
8000045 This is a battle!
8000046 You&#39;re dead!
8000047 Hmm ... surprisingly soft neck ...
8000048 As a warlord, after all, is it a blood bag ...
8000049 Stay away from the reeds ...
8000050 (Fu) * Several types
8000051 Enemy general, Tamura, defeat!
8000052 Reeds, our victory in this battle!
8000053 Kensei, Isshin Ashina
8000054 It was a blood battle of national theft
8000055 Did the stray dog even die?
8000056 Why is it so?
8000057 …interesting. Come with me or a hungry wolf
8000058 You might be a good ninja with one arm
8000059 And at this time
8000060 The wolf picked up on the battlefield
8000061 After training
8000062 Became a master sneak
8000063 Wolf, don&#39;t forget the rules of stealth
8000064 The next most important thing after your parents, you should engrave it in your heart
8000065 That is your lord from today
8000066 Bet your life and protect it, and even if it is robbed, be sure to get it back
8000067 Good, wolf ...
8000068 Will the battle be over ...
8000069 Isshin-sama ...
8000070 Enemy general, Tamura Shuzen, defeat!
9900001 Wolf, live with my blood ...
10000900 What&#39;s your name?
10000901 ………
10000902 That eye ...
10000903 For the time being, a wolf who lost his job ...
10000904 ... I can&#39;t say
10000905 Hmm, that&#39;s a ninja
10000906 I have to carve the Buddha
10000907 You are you and you do n’t like it
10001000 Are you
10001001 I have to carve the Buddha
10001002 You are you and you do n’t like it
10001100 The Buddha carved by 儂 looks angry
10001101 Those who are deep-karma will be
10001102 You&#39;ll know if you carve it someday
10001103 So ... Is it for something?
10001300 I got
10001301 Is it a ninja tool?
10001302 Oh
10001303 Ninja is said to be a fang, but ...
10001304 By adding ninja tools, the fangs can change their shape.
10001305 If it&#39;s a hard shield, it&#39;s crushed ... If it&#39;s a quick enemy, it&#39;s killed.
10001306 The more ninja tools you have prepared, the more you can kill your enemies.
10001307 Have a way to kill the person you want to kill ...
10001308 That&#39;s it
10001309 … Very detailed
10001310 Hmm, I don&#39;t know
10001311 I&#39;m always saying bloody things, so the appearance of the Buddha becomes a demon.
10001312 Which one should I lend you?
10001400 Chirin, Chirin ... and the bell is ringing.
10001401 Is this ... an old bell?
10001402 The old woman said that she should offer it to the Buddha.
10001403 That bell ... Do you remember it?
10001404 No ... I don&#39;t remember
10001405 The bell is different
10001406 There seems to be something I want to say to you
10001407 What did you say…
10001408 Try offering a bell
10001409 The gentle-looking Buddha there is different from the Buddha carved by me.
10001410 Because the true Buddhist priest was carved ...
10001500 Chirin, Chirin ... and the bell is ringing.
10001501 Is this ... an old bell?
10001502 That bell ... Do you remember it?
10001503 No ... I don&#39;t remember
10001504 The bell is different
10001505 There seems to be something I want to say to you
10001506 What did you say…
10001507 Try offering a bell
10001508 The gentle-looking Buddha there is different from the Buddha carved by me.
10001509 Because the true Buddhist priest was carved ...
10001600 Hmm, I talked too much
10001601 Well, whether you offer a bell to the Buddha or not, you should like it.
10001602 and…. Is it for something?
10001700 … Did you come back?
10001701 Is that ... a dream ...
10001702 Or was it really true?
10001703 By the way, is it a dream or a reality?
10001704 One thing I can say ...
10001705 The Buddha just evokes your old memories
10001706 What did you think and how did you remember ...
10001707 Everything depends on it
10001708 I don&#39;t know if everything I see happened right ...
10001709 That&#39;s it
10001800 …You
10001801 Apparently, old memories have awakened
10001802 …Oh
10001803 I saw your child
10001804 Hmm, that&#39;s right
10001805 Don&#39;t listen to the details and don&#39;t talk
10001806 What you see is something you keep inside yourself
10001850 …You
10001851 Apparently, old memories have awakened
10001852 Don&#39;t listen to the details and don&#39;t talk
10001853 What you see is something you keep inside yourself
10001900 The Buddhist temple is ...
10001901 Did you see anything in the Buddha there?
10001902 Did you listen to people?
10001903 How is it
10001904 It&#39;s a flame
10001905 inflammation…?
10001906 Oh, no matter what I offer, I can only see it
10001907 One side ... A flame that burns down the reeds ...
10001908 that is…
10001909 This story is over ...
10002000 Do you get it
10002001 I like it
10002100 Hoo ... You got something interesting
10002101 It is a entwined cylinder
10002102 Ninja&#39;s core gimmick
10002103 Which one, let&#39;s prepare
10002150 What can you do with this gimmick
10002151 If there is this core mechanism ...
10002152 Combined with tube medicine, you can further sharpen the fangs of your shinobi.
10002153 What is a tube medicine
10002154 It&#39;s not iron scraps or smoke glass used with the entwining cylinder.
10002155 If you find a tube medicine that you can use, bring it with you.
10002200 What are you doing
10002201 ……… Your child
10002202 An?
10002203 I was able to save
10002204 It ’s a story that has nothing to do with it.
10002205 No ... thank you
10002206 ...... Hmm
10002207 It looks like the shadows on my eyes have faded
10002208 What did you say
10002209 So ... Is it for something?
10002300 Brought tea
10002301 Hmm ...
10002302 At all ...
10002400 Hey, you ...
10002401 What
10002402 You cut it
10002403 ... what are you talking about
10002404 Hmm ...
10002405 What makes her slash ...
10002406 ask…
10002500 ………
10002501 If it&#39;s a true wolf ...
10002502 You decide how to use your fangs
10002503 … It looks like that face
10002700 Hmm ... You seem to have changed the air a little.
10002701 Something ... It looks like you&#39;ve crossed a big one
10002800 You guys ...
10002801 Where did you get that finger
10002802 The lion monkey in the fall valley was eating
10002803 ……Really
10002804 What&#39;s inside the monkey&#39;s belly
10002805 Don&#39;t lend it
10002806 Let&#39;s put it in your ninja prosthetic hand
10002900 You ... for something
10003000 The gentle-looking Buddha is ...
10003001 A true Buddhist priest is carved
10003002 People face what&#39;s inside them ... and it will help
10003003 What is inside me
10003004 Anger ... Sadness ... Or memories of the old past ...
10003005 That kind of thing
10003100 ……… Hmm
10003101 What
10003102 … You seem to have returned to your intuition
10003103 It looks like it&#39;s becoming more sneaky
10003104 ... special
10003150 is this…
10003151 It&#39;s a ninja technique ...
10003152 The samurai has a ninja fighting technique that cannot be imitated.
10003153 ………
10003154 Well, it&#39;s up to you what to do
10003155 It ’s just a ninja, such as how to fight ...
10003200 That shinobi ...
10003201 It seems that you have become familiar with your arm.
10003202 You guys, save this
10003250 is this…
10003251 How to bite and kill with your fangs ...
10003252 That is written
10003253 In short, it ’s not a battle technique using artificial limbs.
10003254 …Do you get it
10003255 I thought that the ninja technique of artificial limbs was no longer necessary, but ...
10003256 ... I don&#39;t know
10003300 Gehogeho ...
10003301 You too ... Did you come ...
10003302 Hmm ... lively ... lumpy ...
10003400 ………
10003401 Buddhist temple?
10003402 ... No, what are you doing?
10003500 Hmm ... you
10003501 It&#39;s better to offer the bell later
10003502 There must be an order to trace the memory
10003600 ……… Hmm
10003601 Recently, this temple is too lively
10003700 Hmm, did you come too ...
10003701 I&#39;m busy carving Buddha
10080000 Huh ... Gohogoho ...!
10080001 what up…! ??
10080002 Hmm ... Dragon cough
10080003 Overflowing with stagnation, sprinkled ...
10080004 It&#39;s a fatal disease ...
10080005 …what
10080006 Hmm, don&#39;t worry if it&#39;s about me
10080007 I hate it, it&#39;s decent ...
10080008 Jaga ... It&#39;s a pain to talk ...
10080009 After that, ask Emma ... Listen ...
10080100 After that, ask Emma ... Listen ...
10080200 Gohogoho ...
10080201 ... what?
10080600 … And what else?
10080601 ……… Buddhist temple
10080602 &quot;I&#39;m not a decent person&quot;
10080603 What does that mean?
10080604 ……… Hmm
10080605 In such a lonely ruined temple ... I just keep carving the Buddha with an angry look
10080606 It ’s not the work of a decent person.
10080700 ……… Hmm
10080701 In such a lonely ruined temple ... I just keep carving the Buddha with an angry look
10080702 It ’s not the work of a decent person.
10080800 ………
10080801 Did heal
10080802 … Hmm, it ’s Emma…
10080803 For a long time, if you decide to do it, you will do it
10080804 Really
10080805 then…
10080806 ……… Thank you
10011200 Why i am here
10011201 ... I just picked it up
10011202 I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a corpse
10011203 I don&#39;t even feed stray dogs
10011204 How long i was sleeping
10011205 Hmm, it&#39;s been a long time since I picked you up
10011206 …Really
10011207 Jaga ...
10011208 The Lord of Nushi is still alive
10011209 ………！
10011210 In the castle of Ashina, he is in captivity
10011211 However, the blood will soon be used.
10011212 If you look at you, it&#39;s worth it
10011300 It&#39;s been a long time since I picked you up ...
10011301 The Lord of Nushi is still alive
10011302 In the castle of Ashina, he is in captivity
10011303 However, the blood will soon be used.
10011304 If you look at you, it&#39;s worth it
10011400 This left arm ... what did you do to me
10011401 It&#39;s a shinobi
10011402 For the wolf on the arm, it ’s a custom-made fang.
10011403 It&#39;s useless to carve a Buddha. I&#39;ll give it to you
10011404 Shinobi hand ...
10011405 It&#39;s not just about making up for your lost arm
10011406 If you find a ninja, bring it to you
10011407 It&#39;s a ninja tool. Well, this entanglement ...
10011408 Hmm, it&#39;s good to guess
10011409 If you bring a ninja tool, I will put it in a ninja hand
10011410 Well, you&#39;ll understand the gratitude of that prosthetic hand.
10011411 ………
10011412 Hmm, I talked too much ...
10011413 Don&#39;t go
10011500 It&#39;s a shinobi
10011501 For the wolf on the arm, it ’s a custom-made fang.
10011502 If you find a ninja, bring it to you
10011503 I&#39;ll put it in my shinobi
10011504 Well, you&#39;ll understand the gratitude of that prosthetic hand.
10011600 What does it mean that your child&#39;s blood is used?
10011601 I don&#39;t know anything about it. However…
10011602 Dragon seed
10011603 That there is special blood called so
10011604 The Lord of Nushi has it
10011605 Therefore, your child ...
10011606 Targeted
10011607 Maybe that&#39;s why your body is strange.
10011700 Dragon seed
10011701 That there is special blood called so
10011702 The Lord of Nushi has it
10011703 Therefore, it is targeted
10011704 Maybe that&#39;s why your body is strange.
10011800 It&#39;s tea
10011801 ... Sun
10011802 It&#39;s a delicious tea. Do you want to get
10011803 (Gubi ...) Stain ...
10011804 Drinking this reminds me of Emma&#39;s father
10011805 What is Emma&#39;s father ...
10011806 Doxuan...
10011807 He was a rare pharmacist
10011808 And it is also bright in entanglement
10011809 ... No, it ’s an idiot
10011810 He&#39;s a playful guy, but he&#39;s a benefactor ...
10011811 Oh ... I&#39;m also your benefactor
10011812 What does it mean?
10011813 Dogen made it for me when I lost my arm
10011814 Now it ’s on your left arm
10011815 However, even handmade products do not go as expected at first ...
10011816 Remade it over and over again
10011817 Kukuku ...
10011818 what up
10011819 Say it&#39;s a practice to move the ninja prosthesis properly ...
10011820 Emma urged me to carve a top or something
10011821 By repeating such things, it became a substitute that can be called a ninja fang.
10011822 So to speak, the shinobi is ... Dogen&#39;s forgotten memorial
10011823 keepsake…
10011824 (Gubi ...) Ah ... It&#39;s been a long time
10011825 ………
10011826 I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve abandoned my stealth ...
10011827 That&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s thrown away
10011850 It&#39;s tea
10011851 ... Sun
10011852 It&#39;s a delicious tea. Do you want to get
10011853 (Gubi ...) Stain ...
10011854 Drinking this reminds me of Emma&#39;s father
10011855 Dogenden
10011856 Did you know
10011857 He was a rare pharmacist
10011858 And it is also bright in entanglement
10011859 ... No, it ’s an idiot
10011860 He&#39;s a playful guy, but he&#39;s a benefactor ...
10011861 Oh ... I&#39;m also your benefactor
10011862 What does it mean?
10011863 Dogen made it for me when I lost my arm
10011864 Now it ’s on your left arm
10011865 However, even handmade products do not go as expected at first ...
10011866 Remade it over and over again
10011867 Kukuku ...
10011868 what up
10011869 Say it&#39;s a practice to move the ninja prosthesis properly ...
10011870 Emma urged me to carve a top or something
10011871 By repeating such things, it became a substitute that can be called a ninja fang.
10011872 So to speak, the shinobi is ... Dogen&#39;s forgotten memorial
10011873 keepsake…
10011874 (Gubi ...) Ah ... It&#39;s been a long time
10011875 ………
10011876 I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve abandoned my stealth ...
10011877 That&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s thrown away
10011900 I brought liquor
10011901 Let&#39;s get
10011902 (Gubi ...) Umm ...
10011903 ……… Muu…
10011904 Mmm ... Doesn&#39;t it fit your mouth?
10011905 ... No, it ’s good.
10011906 (Gu Big Big Bit) Phu!
10011907 But the scratches are aching
10011908 Is that left arm?
10011909 Oh, for those who like this sake ...
10011910 Kuku ... It was cut off
10011911 that is…
10011912 Isshin-sama
10011913 ... Why is it
10011914 ………
10011915 (Gubi) Slash ...
10011916 (Gu Big Big Bit) Phu!
10011917 I was about to be drunk
10011918 What was it about to be drunk?
10011919 ...Shura
10011920 ………
10011921 (Gui) Well, it&#39;s up to you to believe or not ...
10011922 Be careful at best
10011923 In the shadow of Shura ...
10012000 I brought liquor
10012001 … Is it monkey booze?
10012002 (Gubi ...) Car ... It&#39;s still spicy sake
10012003 But this is nostalgic
10012004 Did you drink well?
10012005 The valley where monkeys live ...
10012006 So I was practicing ninja
10012007 … Are you alone?
10012008 …Disagreeable. Two people
10012009 We&#39;re sneaking up ...
10012010 A decent teacher is no longer
10012011 Therefore, in the valley where you die if you fall, you just run, jump, and cross the blades ...
10012012 Repeated such training
10012013 ... Soon, I was able to move as much as a monkey.
10012014 (Gubi ...) When I got tired of training, I drank this monkey booze.
10012015 And I heard that guy&#39;s crybaby whistle
10012016 crybaby…?
10012017 There was a strange ring ...
10012018 Put it on and blow your finger whistle ...
10012019 In the valley ... a sad sound echoes
10012020 Mysteriously, I don&#39;t like the sound
10012021 I got it blown
10012100 I brought liquor
10012101 Hmm, Ryusen ... It&#39;s pretty good
10012102 Let&#39;s get
10012103 (Gubi ...) It really soaks in ...
10012104 (Gubi ...) After all, this is it
10012105 I used to drink with Dogen ...
10012106 Have Emma measure it
10012107 Is it a long relationship with Emma?
10012108 Oh, a long time ago ...
10012109 Picked up on the battlefield
10012110 …battlefield
10012111 I&#39;ve been staring at the rice balls for a long time
10012112 It&#39;s a hassle, so I gave it to you
10012113 Then, something came along ...
10012114 then…
10012115 ………
10012116 Hmm, what&#39;s the matter ...
10012117 Both became troublesome for Ashina
10012118 It was then that I became the adopted daughter of Dogen.
10012119 ………
10012120 Well, wherever
10012121 I&#39;m much happier than sneaking up
10012200 Only the demon Buddha can carve 儂
10012201 The Buddha in the tree ...
10012202 You&#39;re always angry
10012203 You can see it, it&#39;s better than carving it
10012300 I abandoned the ninja
10012301 However, only that ninja hand cannot be thrown away
10012302 That 儂 picks up you who lost your arm ...
10012303 Causal
10012400 ……… Hmm
10012500 Oh ... I&#39;m thirsty
10012501 I want to drink tea
10012600 I was asked by my care-giving daughter ...
10012601 I&#39;m keeping your guard
10012602 This guy was originally entrusted by the Lord of Nushi
10012603 Also, why don&#39;t you bring it with you?
10012604 Well, I wonder if I&#39;m going on the road of hardship as it is ...
10012700 Let&#39;s get it back
10012701 Oh, that&#39;s good
10012702 For further hardships ...
10012703 Also, it&#39;s okay to carry it on your back when the next opportunity comes
10012800 ………
10012801 That&#39;s right
10012802 Well, I hope you like it
10080400 Gohogoho ...
10080401 Buddhist temple ...
10080402 Hmm, I don&#39;t need to worry
10080403 I hate it, it&#39;s decent ...
10080404 Like a dragon cough ... I won&#39;t die
10080500 Gohogoho ...
10080501 It ’s a dragon cough medicine.
10080502 Emma made it for me
10080503 Emma ... is that so?
10080504 (Gokun)
10080505 ……… Kofu…
10080506 How is it?
10080507 Well ... it&#39;s a little easier ...
10020100 You too ...
10020101 Weird guests come to this Araji Temple as it is
10020102 There is one such person in the square on the right after leaving the temple.
10020103 Those who are supposed to be strange ...
10020104 Maybe I&#39;ll get along
10020200 Ah ... the gentle-looking Buddha there ...
10020201 Don&#39;t imitate it strangely
10020300 If the entanglement tube is installed ...
10020301 Combined with tube medicine, you can further sharpen the fangs of your shinobi.
10020302 If you find a tube medicine that you can use, bring it with you.
10020400 I want to increase the shape of my fangs ...
10020401 At best, I&#39;ve been looking for a ninja tool
10020402 It ’s the boat I ’m on
10020403 Let&#39;s just prepare
10020500 …You
10020501 That finger whistle is surely ...
10020502 Sad ... but it will make a good sound
10020503 Use it well
10020600 Then
10020601 Also, I&#39;ll lend you an eaves
10020700 ……… Hey, you
10020701 What
10020702 Did you know
10020703 This stormy temple has a terrible draft.
10020704 ………Do you get it
10020800 …You
10020801 At best
10080300 ……… Zehi…
10090000 Gehogeho ...
10090001 Yeah, that&#39;s enough
10090002 Thank you, Shojo
10090003 Hmm, Emma
10090004 The blood that my grandfather spit out ... What should I do ...
10090005 Investigate the dragon cough
10090006 I want to find a cure
10090007 heavy drinker…. It&#39;s also for you
10090008 ... that&#39;s right
10090009 However, it is unnecessary care. This kind of thing is on your own ...
10090010 ……HM…
10090011 Well ... let me show you ...
10090012 Dragon cough blood ... you ...
10090013 How ... I get sick ...
10090014 ……… Ket, Dogen…
10090015 Emma&#39;s guy, it&#39;s just like you
10090100 heavy drinker…. The army of the inner prefecture is coming
10090101 ……Really
10090102 As usual, those who like to take away ...
10090103 The flames ... aren&#39;t they extinguished yet?
10090104 Emma ...
10090105 No matter how many times I ask, it doesn&#39;t change
10090106 No matter how much you carve the Buddha, you can&#39;t extinguish the flames of grudges
10090107 Hold it down, but at best
10090108 ………heavy drinker
10090109 What is it
10090110 If that time comes, at least I ...
10090111 ………
10090112 I&#39;m busy carving Buddha ... Then ...
10090200 Hey, Emma ...
10090201 Is that okay for you?
10090202 I don&#39;t know
10090203 To make an immortality ...
10090204 Kuro-sama, that person ...
10090205 One of them has to die
10090206 ………
10090207 Why is there only such a way ...
10090208 So ... do you hide it?
10090209 Because ...
10090210 If you give this, that person will surely die
10090300 ... Emma
10090301 Are you glad you let me go?
10090302 ... I stopped
10090303 That person will go
10090304 Hmm, I guess
10090305 ... Hey, Shojo
10090306 At least I want to hope
10090307 That person will accomplish
10090308 Oh, that&#39;s good
10070400 Woo, Woooooooooooo
10070401 Is it the flame of grudge ...
10070450 Woo, Woooooooooooo
10071100 Guru ... Guoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!
10071101 Buddhist temple ...
10071150 Guru ... Guoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!
10070500 Guu, Guooo
10070600 Guu ... Aaaaaaa!
10070700 Woooooooooooooo
10070900 You ask ...
10070901 Buddhist temple ...
10070950 You ask ...
10071000 Farewell, Buddhist priest ...
10071001 You ... Thank you ... Thank you ...
10071001 You ... Thank you ... Thank you ...
11000000 Wolf ...
11000001 Seems to be hurt
11000002 …That&#39;s it. Let&#39;s entrust this to you
11000003 It&#39;s a gourd of medicinal water
11000004 Heal your wounds with this
11000010 Haha
11000011 Now…
11000012 Your body ... Isn&#39;t it important after that?
11000013 After that ...
11000014 … Do you remember that night?
11000015 Okay
11000016 Hmm ...
11000017 ... No, let&#39;s leave the details later
11000018 Now I have to take off this castle of Ashina
11000019 Yuyi
11000020 There is a loophole to the outside of the castle under the bridge along the moat
11000021 I&#39;ve heard that from Isshin-sama
11000022 First of all, I want you to find a loophole under the bridge.
11000023 If you find it, that&#39;s right ...
11000024 Can you give me a signal with the reed leaf flute?
11000025 You see, I guess you told me a long time ago
11000026 Let&#39;s go to you, relying on that sound
11000050 Haha
11000051 Now…
11000052 Your body ... Isn&#39;t it important after that?
11000053 After that ...
11000054 … Do you remember that night?
11000055 Okay
11000056 Hmm ...
11000057 ... No, let&#39;s leave the details later
11000058 Now I have to take off this castle of Ashina
11000059 Yuyi
11000060 There is a loophole to the outside of the castle under the bridge along the moat
11000061 I&#39;ve heard that from Isshin-sama
11000062 First of all, I want you to find a loophole under the bridge.
11000063 If you find it, that&#39;s right ...
11000064 Can you give me a signal with the reed leaf flute?
11000065 You see, I guess you told me a long time ago
11000066 Let&#39;s go to you, relying on that sound
11000067 ………
11000068 Hmm? Wolf, is there anything from you?
11000100 Under the bridge along the moat, there is a loophole to the outside of the castle
11000101 I want you to find a loophole under the bridge to escape from this reed castle.
11000102 If you find it, give me a signal
11000103 Let&#39;s use the reed leaf flute as a sign for you and me
11000150 Under the bridge along the moat, there is a loophole to the outside of the castle
11000151 I want you to find a loophole under the bridge to escape from this reed castle.
11000152 If you find it, give me a signal
11000153 Let&#39;s use the reed leaf flute as a sign for you and me
11000154 ………
11000155 Hmm? Wolf, is there anything from you?
11000200 Let&#39;s leave this castle and go to Izuko
11000201 First of all, will you leave the country of Ashina ...
11000202 Or hide yourself somewhere ...
11000203 What do you think?
11000204 At will
11000205 Do you mean ... you&#39;re the same
11000206 Is
11000207 ... No, I feel nostalgic
11000208 Let&#39;s come
11000300 let&#39;s go
11000301 If you pass through here, it&#39;s outside the castle of Ashina
11000400 Wolf
11000401 Your body ... Isn&#39;t it important after that?
11000402 After that ...
11000403 … Do you remember that night?
11000404 Okay
11000405 Hmm ...
11000406 ... No, let&#39;s leave the details later
11000407 Now I have to take off this castle of Ashina
11000408 Yuyi
11000409 There is a loophole to the outside of the castle under the bridge along the moat
11000410 I&#39;ve heard that from Isshin-sama
11000411 First of all, I want you to find a loophole under the bridge.
11000412 If you find it, that&#39;s right ...
11000413 Can you give me a signal with the reed leaf flute?
11000414 You see, I guess you told me a long time ago
11000415 Let&#39;s go to you, relying on that sound
11000416 ………
11000417 Hmm? Wolf, is there anything from you?
11010000 House…
11010001 Really. Then I asked, wolf
11010100 Give this to your child
11010101 That was at that time ...
11010102 Yeah, I was aware
11010103 I want you to have it
11010104 However, this omamori has kept you from suffering until now.
11010105 I don&#39;t want you to bear the hardships that go beyond that ...
11010106 So, if possible, please bring it as it is
11010150 Give this to your child
11010151 I want you to have it
11010152 However, this omamori has kept you from suffering until now.
11010153 I don&#39;t want you to bear the hardships that go beyond that ...
11010154 So, if possible, please bring it as it is
11010200 If you have a hard time, where you want
11010201 This will be returned to your child
11010202 Do you get it. Thank you…
11010203 Waiting for you is a path of hardship that has never been seen before
11010204 But you can overcome it
11010205 Wolf, I believe so
11010300 I understand
11010301 I will keep it for a while
11010302 Um, do it
11010303 If you bring it, I&#39;m relieved
11040000 Wolf
11040001 There is one more thing I want to give you
11040002 Receive
11040100 ... wolf
11040101 Don&#39;t overdo it
11040102 Please heal your wounds
11050000 Wolf, you said
11050001 &quot;Do what you should do&quot;
11050002 I still can&#39;t find it
11050003 I don&#39;t know
11050004 The dragon seed was bestowed on me for some reason ...
11060000 Where ... then ... the wolf ...
11102200 I came to pick you up, my lord
11102201 … Um, he came often
11102202 Let&#39;s visit
11102203 I have to take off the reed name
11102204 ……… Wolf
11102205 My blood ... Dragon seeds let people die
11102206 You&#39;re right
11102207 …Okay
11102208 I wanted to save you
11102209 I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll do the same if I can go back in time
11102210 But ...
11102211 Not dying creates stagnation
11102212 Immortality, weird water, dragon cough, all so
11102213 Distorts a person&#39;s way of life as a person
11102214 I want to break the chain of stagnation that the immortality of the dragon seeds gives birth to
11102215 Wolf, can you help me with that?
11102300 It ’s about immortality, but it ’s not groundless.
11102301 Wolf, this
11102350 It&#39;s an old record left in this reed castle
11102351 Sengo ... The tears of the god dragon ...
11102352 Oh, if there were tears of that dragon ... maybe I could cut off my dragon seed
11102353 But ... What is Sengo?
11102354 Umm ...
11102355 Wolf, look at the incense burner there
11102356 Someone had it
11102400 This incense burner is ...
11102401 Once in this reed castle ...
11102402 I hear that a son of a dragon seed different from me was living
11102403 The name of the child is Mr. Takeshi ...
11102404 This incense burner is related to that person
11102405 That person is now ...
11102406 It&#39;s been a long time since I passed away
11102407 &quot;Wearing the scent of the source, return to Senkyo&quot;
11102408 Yes
11102409 In other words, the scent of the source ... that is the key to Senkyo.
11102410 Probably
11102411 Wolf, let&#39;s unravel it first
11102500 And how to find out ...
11102501 In this castle, there is a book with a length left
11102502 It must have been collected in search of a way to return to Senkyo.
11102503 I&#39;ll explore that
11102504 Not only how to get to Senkyo ...
11102505 Immortality ... Search for itself
11102506 Oh, then it ’s a single heart.
11102507 If you are that person, you may know something
11102508 Wolf, here
11102600 Isshin-sama is resting in the turret outside the castle tower.
11102601 However, the separation is closed
11102602 It&#39;s a little sloppy ...
11102603 How to enter
11102604 On the roof, there is a road for the people of Yataka
11102605 It&#39;s a road used by ninja, but you can follow it.
11102606 The people of the night hawk use the signal smoke as a mark
11102607 Ah, if you follow the signal of the night hawk, you will be able to go to the distance
11102608 You can get out on the roof from this hinged window.
11102700 I want you to meet Isshin and hear the clues to immortality.
11102701 Please rest in a turret outside this castle tower.
11102702 From the hinged window, go out onto the roof and follow the signal of the night hawk, and you&#39;ll be there.
11102703 I asked
11102800 Keho ... Hmm ... The dust is terrible ...
11102801 I&#39;m back
11102802 Oh, you&#39;re back, the wolf
11102803 Did you meet Isshin-sama?
11102804 Okay
11102805 Immortal slashing could be the key
11102806 Yes, I told you
11102807 Immortal slash ...
11102808 A sword that cuts dead things in Senmineji
11102809 I see ... It may have something to do with cutting off the immortality of the dragon.
11102810 Yuyi
11102811 For me ... Kehokeho ... I&#39;ve caught a book that could be a clue to the scent of the source.
11102812 Apparently, it was being investigated for Senkyo to return to Senkyo.
11102813 Let&#39;s talk about the clues we found
11102814 What are clues ...
11102815 Flower ...
11102850 Keho ... Hmm ... The dust is terrible ...
11102851 I&#39;m back
11102852 Oh, you&#39;re back, the wolf
11102853 Did you meet Isshin-sama?
11102854 Okay
11102855 Immortal slashing could be the key
11102856 Yes, I told you
11102857 Immortal slash ...
11102858 I see ... It may have something to do with cutting off the immortality of the dragon.
11102859 Yuyi
11102860 For me ... Kehokeho ... I&#39;ve caught a book that could be a clue to the scent of the source.
11102861 Apparently, it was being investigated for Senkyo to return to Senkyo.
11102862 Let&#39;s talk about the clues we found
11102863 What are clues ...
11102864 Flower ...
11102900 In order to reach Senkyo, we have to find out about the aroma of the source.
11102901 Let&#39;s talk about the clues we found
11103000 Incense collection to reach Senkyo has also progressed.
11103001 Wolf, I&#39;ll continue to ask
11103100 Oh wolf
11103101 I found a new clue
11103102 It&#39;s a stone
11103103 What is a stone
11103104 Look at this
11103150 is this…
11103151 It ’s a book written by someone who asked for the incense of the source.
11103152 It seems that there is a village where fragrant stones are enshrined.
11103153 But I&#39;ve never heard of such a village
11103154 Hmm ... It says that the village is at the bottom of the reed name ...
11103155 At the bottom of that well, where the Lord beside the moon-viewing tower had been dropped ...
11103156 I&#39;ve heard that there is a deep hole in the bottom
11103157 Or maybe it has something to do with it
11103158 Let&#39;s explore
11103159 Oh. But tossing is ...
11103170 is this…
11103151 It ’s a book written by someone who asked for the incense of the source.
11103152 It seems that there is a village where fragrant stones are enshrined.
11103171 ………
11103172 What&#39;s wrong, the wolf?
11103173 Hmm? The strangely shaped stone you have ...
11103174 Is it the source incense stone?
11103175 Haha
11103176 This stone was enshrined
11103177 Oh, that&#39;s exactly what the book says
11103178 Okay. On the altar where the stone was ...
11103179 Dedicated to the sword
11103180 Yes, it was written
11103181 Carrying ... Hmm
11103182 Where is it
11103183 It is a cave in the back of Iwato
11103184 Hmm ... From such a place ... Where are you going to get on your litter and get married?
11103185 Well, even if you think about it
11103186 I&#39;m sorry ...
11103187 Hmm?
11103188 Kuro-sama ... That place may be the entrance to Sengo.
11103189 ………Really
11103190 To be fragrant ... is to wear the scent of the source ...
11103191 I might be pointing to that
11103200 Miko, I tried to smell the remaining incense in the incense burner
11103201 Oh, right? How was it?
11103202 Okay
11103203 Somehow ... there was something like wood chips left
11103204 And a faint cherry blossom-like scent ...
11103205 Oh, did you think so too?
11103206 But that scent ... it&#39;s like cherry blossoms, it&#39;s a little different ...
11103207 Hmm ...
11103208 ………
11103209 What&#39;s wrong, the wolf
11103210 That scent ... somewhere nostalgic ...
11103211 Have you ever had a problem?
11103212 Probably ... but I can&#39;t remember
11103213 by the way…
11103214 Emma once said that there was a cherry tree behind the castle
11103215 It may be related
11103300 I asked Emma about the cherry tree
11103301 Oh how was it?
11103302 The cherry blossoms are the ones that Senkyo brought from Senkyo ...
11103303 But now it&#39;s withered and doesn&#39;t seem to remain
11103304 Really…
11103305 but…
11103306 Someone says that he broke the branch of Tsunesakura and took it away.
11103307 Hmm ... who does that
11103308 ………
11103309 ... what&#39;s lost can&#39;t be helped
11103310 Even if the branches were taken away, there are no clues now.
11103311 Let&#39;s collect other incense first
11103312 Yuyi
11103400 Miko, I got the incense flower of the source
11103401 Oh, after all, was it blooming in the fall valley?
11103402 Yes, in the depths of the fall valley
11103403 Does that mean that the source water flow was a dense place?
11103404 Well got it, wolf
11103450 Miko, I got the incense flower of the source
11103451 Oh, after all, was it blooming in the fall valley?
11103452 Yes, in the depths of the fall valley
11103453 Does that mean that the source water flow was a dense place?
11103454 Well got it, wolf
11103455 Oh yeah
11103456 I&#39;ve been investigating too
11103457 I found the new incense I needed
11103458 that is
11103459 The blood of the Son of the Dragon Seed ... In other words, my blood
11103460 Kuro-sama&#39;s blood ...
11103461 But it shouldn&#39;t flow
11103462 Ah ... that&#39;s what the Son of the Dragon Seed is.
11103463 However, I found a memoir of Kosho&#39;s Kosho in the room of Genichiro.
11103464 There seems to be some way to shed blood
11103465 Let&#39;s give this to you for the time being
11103480 By the way ... How did I find out how to shed my blood?
11103481 How about asking Emma?
11103482 Hmm ... If you&#39;re a pharmacist, is it bright for your body?
11103483 Certainly, it may be exactly what you say
11103500 is this…
11103501 It ’s a book written by someone who asked for the incense of the source.
11103502 It seems that there is a village where fragrant stones are enshrined.
11103503 ………
11103504 What&#39;s wrong, the wolf?
11103505 Hmm? The strangely shaped stone you have ...
11103506 Is it the source incense stone?
11103507 Haha
11103508 This stone was enshrined
11103509 Oh, that&#39;s exactly what the book says
11103510 Okay. On the altar where the stone was ...

11103542 Hmm ... If you&#39;re a pharmacist, is it bright for your body?
11103543 Certainly, it may be exactly what you say
11109000 Miko, I got the material for incense
11109001 Oh, that&#39;s ... the source incense stone
11109002 Don&#39;t have a strange shape
11109003 This stone was enshrined
11109004 Hmm ... It&#39;s a strange custom, such as worshiping a stone like this.
11109005 Okay. On the altar where the stone was ...
11109006 Dedicated to the sword
11109007 Yes, it was written
11109008 Carrying ... Hmm
11109009 Where is it

11109054 Yeah, it was exactly as Mr. Takeshi wrote

11109187 Hmm ... If you&#39;re a pharmacist, is it bright for your body?
11109188 Certainly, it may be exactly what you say
11103700 My blood is also not a source of incense
11103701 Emma, the pharmacist, may know something about how to shed my blood.
11103702 Will you ask Emma?
11103800 Did you talk to Emma, the wolf?
11103801 Okay
11103802 How was it? Did you understand anything?
11103803 If it&#39;s an immortal slash, it will come true
11103804 …Really
11103805 If it&#39;s an immortal slash, shedding my blood will come true.
11103806 Okay
11103807 I hear that the immortal sword is in Senmineji
11103808 Can you get it
11103809 Yuyi
11103830 Did you talk to Emma, the wolf?
11103831 Okay
11103832 How was it? Did you understand anything?
11103833 If it&#39;s an immortal slash, it will come true
11103834 …Really
11103835 If it&#39;s an immortal slash, shedding my blood will come true.
11103836 Okay
11103837 Hmm ... Why don&#39;t you try it?
11103838 Immortal sword is originally a sword that cannot be pulled out
11103839 It may be a hindrance
11103840 Burning incense ... At that time, I wonder if it&#39;s okay
11103841 Hmm ... If you say that much, let&#39;s do it
11103860 Did you talk to Emma, the wolf?
11103861 Okay
11103862 How was it? Did you understand anything?
11103863 If it&#39;s an immortal slash, it will come true
11103864 …Really
11103865 If it&#39;s an immortal slash, shedding my blood will come true.
11103866 Okay
11103867 With this ... the incense material will be everything
11103868 Wolf, let&#39;s burn incense
11103869 …Yuyi
11103900 Wolf, the sword on his back is ...
11103901 I&#39;m in an immortal sword
11103902 Is that ... a sword that kills things that don&#39;t die?
11103903 Okay
11103904 Received from the strange child of Senmineji Temple
11103905 A strange child?
11103906 The people of Senmineji were fascinated by the quest to abandon the monks and not die.
11103907 A person with a false dragon seed born at the end of that ...
11103908 That is the young children
11103909 False dragon seeds ... something like that ...
11103910 wait…. Sons, we ...
11103911 Okay
11103912 Many weird children were born ... but only one survived
11103913 Ryusei ... After all, it distorts the existence of people ...?
11103914 Immortality, I have to do it
11103915 Yuyi
11103950 Wolf, the sword on his back is ...
11103951 I&#39;m in an immortal sword
11103952 Is that ... a sword that kills things that don&#39;t die?
11103953 Okay
11103954 Received from the strange child of Senmineji Temple
11103955 A strange child?
11103956 The people of Senmineji were fascinated by the quest to abandon the monks and not die.
11103957 A person with a false dragon seed born at the end of that ...
11103958 That is the young children
11103959 False dragon seeds ... something like that ...
11103960 wait…. Sons, we ...
11103961 Okay
11103962 Many weird children were born ... but only one survived
11103963 Ryusei ... After all, it distorts the existence of people ...?
11103964 With the immortal slash I received, I can shed my blood
11103965 With this ... The fragrance of the source is closer to one more
11103966 Immortality, I have to do it
11103967 Yuyi
11104000 Are you back, wolf
11104001 Yes, Kuro-sama has something to keep
11104002 What to keep?
11104003 this
11104050 Is this ... rice?
11104051 Yes, the son of Senmineji is to Kuro-sama ...
11104052 Well, thank you
11104053 Looks like good rice ... Huh, it&#39;s really shiny
11104054 When you chew, it&#39;s sweet
11104055 bite…?
11104056 Wolf ... It ’s better to cook and eat rice.
11104057 Haha
11104058 Hmm ... Do you like sweets?
11104059 I will eat anything
11104060 Then I don&#39;t hate it
11104061 Good, let&#39;s make something good for you
11104062 What is good ...
11104063 Haha ... I&#39;m looking forward to it
11104100 Let&#39;s make something good for you with the rice you received
11104101 What is good ...
11104102 Haha ... It&#39;s fun again
11104200 Huhhh ... I&#39;ve been waiting, wolf
11104201 Come on, get your hands on it!
11104202 Haha
11104250 is this…
11104251 Ohagi!
11104252 The rice that was given to the Mikoden of Senmineji Temple was used to hold it.
11104253 Don&#39;t hesitate, try eating
11104300 Ohagi, which is made with the rice you received
11104301 Don&#39;t hesitate, try eating
11104400 How was my wolf, wolf?
11104401 Thank you
11104402 Will
11104403 I&#39;ve loved making sweets since I was little
11104404 Even in Hirata&#39;s mansion, he used to go into the kitchen.
11104405 Eventually ... I&#39;ll open a teahouse when I have free time
11104500 Wolf…
11104501 Safe, above all
11104502 The owl is ...
11104503 Slashed
11104504 (That!)
11104505 ……… I&#39;m sorry
11104506 Kuro
11104507 I&#39;m sorry ...
11104508 I did what I should do
11104509 Wolf…
11104510 Thank you…
11104511 My father-in-law ...
11104512 Had this
11104513 (What !?) This is ...! Is it a branch of everlasting cherry blossoms ...?
11104514 I see ... Did the owl have ...
11104515 Okay…
11104516 With this, we are closer to the source incense.
11104517 Ah ... ah ...
11104518 Yeah, wolf ...
11104550 Wolf…
11104551 Safe, above all
11104552 The owl is ...
11104553 Slashed
11104554 (That!)
11104555 ……… I&#39;m sorry
11104556 Kuro
11104557 I&#39;m sorry ...
11104558 I did what I should do
11104559 Wolf…
11104560 Thank you…
11104561 My father-in-law ...
11104562 Had this
11104563 (What !?) This is ...! Is it a branch of everlasting cherry blossoms ...?
11104564 I see ... Did the owl have ...
11104565 Okay…
11104566 With this, I&#39;m sure ... Let&#39;s make the incense of the source
11104567 Ah ... ah ...
11104568 Don&#39;t finally come true, wolf ...
11104600 Wolf ... Don&#39;t finally come true ...
11104601 With this, I&#39;m sure ... the scent of the source can be burned and dyed.
11104602 Now, put what you have collected in the incense burner.
11104603 Yuyi
11104700 Your child ...
11104701 Wolf, immortal slash ...
11104702 ………
11104703 … Don&#39;t worry. Deeply, it doesn&#39;t cut
11104704 Will you pull out the immortal sword?
11104705 …Okay
11104706 ... I&#39;m sorry ...
11104707 Close your eyes
11104708 ...... ha ...
11104750 … Is n’t it important?
11104751 All right. I just cut a little around my chest
11104752 ………
11104753 Is this the scent of the source?
11104754 Somehow ... asexually nostalgic ...
11104755 Okay…
11104756 How has something changed ...
11104757 With the smell ... and ...
11104758 Source Palace ...
11104759 That word never leaves my head
11104760 Source Palace ...
11104761 As Mr. Takeshi was left behind, it seems that he is connected to Senkyo from there.
11104762 How to get to the source shrine ...
11104763 &quot;It&#39;s adorable, and it&#39;s a good idea.&quot;
11104764 It was written on the altar where the scented stone was placed.
11104765 Um, you&#39;re wearing the scent of the source
11104766 If you enter the litter in the back of Iwato, you will be able to open the way to the Gennomiya.
11104767 Immortality is coming soon ... I&#39;ll ask, wolf ...
11104768 …Yuyi
11104800 Wolf, head to Senkyo and get the tears of the dragon
11104801 Okay
11104802 First, go to the back of Iwato, where you got a scented stone.
11104803 You are wearing the scent of the source
11104804 If you enter the litter in the back of Iwato, you will be able to open the way to the Gennomiya.
11104805 Yuyi
11104900 Your child ...
11104901 Wolf, well back ...
11104902 Did you reach the Gennomiya?
11104903 Okay
11104904 Yeah, I was thinking
11104905 Dragon tears
11104906 I will definitely get it
11104907 Oh, beg ... wolf
11105000 ………
11105001 Sue ... Sue ... Sue ...
11105100 ………
11105101 … Please be safe
11105102 ……Hmm?
11105103 Oh, a wolf? Isn&#39;t it important?
11105104 Haha
11105105 That&#39;s right. This to you
11105110 A person fluttered from the window.
11105111 You two may be thinking about yourself
11105112 Dragon tears
11105113 I will definitely get it
11105114 Oh, beg ... wolf
11105200 something…
11105201 The army of the inner prefecture seems to be noisy
11105202 … But don&#39;t worry, the wolf
11105203 Occasionally, Isshin comes to see the situation
11105204 It ’s encouraging
11105300 Well then, the wolf
11105301 There are items in the library that might help you.
11105302 If you like, please help me
11105400 by the way…
11105401 There is a door with the shape of a person written on it ...
11105402 Isshin-sama called it a loophole for ninja.
11105403 I don&#39;t know what it is, but ...
11105404 It has the name of ninja. If you can use it
11106000 Is that ... a sword that kills things that don&#39;t die?
11106001 I don&#39;t think I already have it
11106002 Okay
11106003 Received from the strange child of Senmineji Temple
11106004 A strange child?
11106005 The people of Senmineji were fascinated by the quest to abandon the monks and not die.
11106006 A person with a false dragon seed born at the end of that ...
11106007 That is the young children
11106008 False dragon seeds ... something like that ...
11106009 wait…. Sons, we ...
11106010 Okay
11106011 Many weird children were born ... but only one survived
11106012 Ryusei ... After all, it distorts the existence of people ...?
11106013 Immortality, I have to do it
11106014 Yuyi
11106050 Is that ... a sword that kills things that don&#39;t die?
11106051 I don&#39;t think I already have it
11106052 Okay
11106053 Received from the strange child of Senmineji Temple
11106054 A strange child?
11106055 The people of Senmineji were fascinated by the quest to abandon the monks and not die.
11106056 A person with a false dragon seed born at the end of that ...
11106057 That is the young children
11106058 False dragon seeds ... something like that ...
11106059 wait…. Sons, we ...
11106060 Okay
11106061 Many weird children were born ... but only one survived
11106062 Ryusei ... After all, it distorts the existence of people ...?
11106063 With the immortal slash I received, I can shed my blood
11106064 With this ... The fragrance of the source is closer to one more
11106065 Immortality, I have to do it
11106066 Yuyi
11109500 Wolf…
11109501 Safe, above all
11109502 The owl is ...
11109503 Slashed
11109504 (That!)
11109505 ……… I&#39;m sorry
11109506 Kuro
11109507 I&#39;m sorry ...
11109508 I did what I should do
11109509 Wolf…
11109510 Thank you…
11109511 My father-in-law ...
11109512 Had this
11109513 (What !?) This is ...! Is it a branch of everlasting cherry blossoms ...?
11109514 I see ... Did the owl have ...
11109515 Branch of everlasting cherry blossoms ...
11109516 It ’s a story I heard from Emma.
11109517 Tsunezakura is a cherry blossom brought by Mr. Takeshi from Senkyo.
11109518 It is said that it used to bloom behind this castle
11109519 However, someone broke the branch and took away the flower ...
11109520 It seems that the everlasting cherry blossoms have withered before long.
11109521 This is the branch of the everlasting cherry blossoms ...
11109522 Oh, maybe
11109523 With this, we are closer to the source incense.
11109524 Ah ... ah ...
11109525 Yeah, wolf ...
11109550 Wolf…
11109551 Safe, above all
11109552 The owl is ...
11109553 Slashed
11109554 (That!)
11109555 ……… I&#39;m sorry
11109556 Kuro
11109557 I&#39;m sorry ...
11109558 I did what I should do
11109559 Wolf…
11109560 Thank you…
11109561 My father-in-law ...
11109562 Had this
11109563 (What !?) This is ...! Is it a branch of everlasting cherry blossoms ...?
11109564 I see ... Did the owl have ...
11109565 Branch of everlasting cherry blossoms ...
11109566 It ’s a story I heard from Emma.
11109567 Tsunezakura is a cherry blossom brought by Mr. Takeshi from Senkyo.
11109568 It is said that it used to bloom behind this castle
11109569 However, someone broke the branch and took away the flower ...
11109570 It seems that the everlasting cherry blossoms have withered before long.
11109571 This is the branch of the everlasting cherry blossoms ...
11109572 Oh, maybe
11109573 With this, I&#39;m sure ... Let&#39;s make the incense of the source
11109574 Ah ... ah ...
11109575 Don&#39;t finally come true, wolf ...
11110500 (Father-in-law ...)
11110501 (I can&#39;t break the rules of iron)
11110600 I can&#39;t do it
11110601 Protecting your child
11110602 If it is imposed by my father-in-law
11110603 How many times have you died and revived to save me ...?
11110604 Twice or three times ...
11110605 Or is it countless?
11110606 As many times as you want to protect your child
11110607 Immortal you ...
11110608 I don&#39;t want to be tied up for eternity
11110609 Wolf ... Please do immortality together
11110610 (That!) …… Your will
11110611 Thank you, wolf
11110700 Son, this
11110701 That bell ... I&#39;m familiar with it
11110702 About Hirata ... I remember that night ...
11110703 ………
11110704 I&#39;m sorry, the wolf
11110705 I brought it with me, but ... I don&#39;t need it anymore
11110706 It is said that there is a rough temple in the castle where you can store things with such a thing.
11110707 Emma is also a temple I often visit
11110708 Wolf, can you bring a bell and make a memorial service?
11110709 I understand
11110710 I will offer it to the Buddha of the Araji Temple
11110800 ... the bell is familiar
11110801 About Hirata ... I remember that night ...
11110802 It is said that there is a rough temple in the castle where you can store things with such a thing.
11110803 Emma is also a temple I often visit
11110804 Wolf, can you bring a bell and make a memorial service?
11110805 I understand
11110806 I will offer it to the Buddha of the Araji Temple
11110900 Your child, here ...
11110901 This is ...
11110902 Sakura Shizuku
11110903 that is…
11110904 When the immortal contract of Ryusei is not made ...
11110905 What remains in exchange
11110906 Is the length left behind?
11110907 Would be ...
11110908 Wolf, if you want ...
11110909 Let&#39;s use this machete as your power
11110940 A contract with your child is enough
11110941 Do you get it
11110942 But for me, don&#39;t worry
11110943 Tell me again whenever you need it
11119200 Thank you ...
11119201 Do you get it
11119202 Close your eyes
11119203 Is ...
11119250 It&#39;s what I received from Mr.
11119251 Take care
11119252 Yuyi
11119300 Close your eyes
11119301 Is ...
11111000 What is a flower?
11111001 First of all, this
11111050 is this…
11111051 The length is what was left
11111052 I think I was investigating the scent of the source to return to Senkyo.
11111053 The water that runs through this reed name and flows out of the source ...
11111054 It is written about the white flowers that bloom in the place where the water collects thickly.
11111055 Apparently it is one of the source incense
11111056 A place where the source water is thickly collected ...
11111057 Is it a deep canyon?
11111058 I see…. Then it might be Ochiya
11111059 The source water should also be flowing into that valley
11111060 The fall valley is everywhere
11111061 It&#39;s just past the forest behind the castle
11111062 A white snake shrine in the depths of the forest ...
11111063 As the word says, there is a fall valley where you fall from there.
11111064 A decent road isn&#39;t connected, but you could go
11111100 The scent of the source, one of them
11111101 It will be a white flower that blooms in a place where the source water is thick
11111102 Okay. I will explore the fallen valley
11111103 Ochiya is beyond the forest behind the castle.
11111104 A white snake shrine in the depths of the forest ...
11111105 As the word says, there is a fall valley where you fall from there.
11111106 A decent road isn&#39;t connected, but you could go
11111200 Child, here
11111201 is this…
11111202 Is it the book written by the person who sought the incense of the source?
11111203 Okay
11111204 A village where fragrant stones are enshrined ...
11111205 But I&#39;ve never heard of such a village
11111206 There is a bottom of the reed name
11111207 ... Speaking of which, the Lord beside the Tsukimi Tower was dropped, at the end of that well ...
11111208 I&#39;ve heard that there is a deep hole in the bottom
11111209 Or maybe it has something to do with it
11111210 Let&#39;s explore
11111211 Oh. But tossing is ...
11111220 I do not understand
11111221 Hmm ... I&#39;m not sure
11111222 Can you find a place you can think of?
11111223 Is ...
11111230 Throwing ground ...
11111231 I saw such a thing
11111232 That is ...
11111233 There is a large hole with an invisible bottom in the back of the abandoned prison
11111234 The old woman who was there ...
11111235 Throw yourself into that hole
11111236 … Hmm, the point where I threw myself is connected somewhere
11111237 Okay
11111238 I felt the flow of the wind faintly from the direction of passing through the torii gate.
11111239 I&#39;m going to jump over there as a test
11111240 ... Okay, be careful
11111300 The fragrant stones and the enshrined village are at the bottom of the reeds ...
11111301 At the bottom of that well, where the Lord beside the moon-viewing tower had been dropped ...
11111302 I&#39;ve heard that there is a deep hole in the bottom
11111303 Maybe the bottom of the reed name is beyond that ...
11111304 But tossing is ...
11111400 It is said that the village where the fragrant stones are enshrined is at the bottom of the reed name.
11111401 If you jump off the throwing ground, you&#39;ll probably get there
11111402 I felt the flow of the wind faintly from the direction of passing through the torii gate.
11111403 I&#39;ll jump over there
11111404 ... Okay, be careful
11111500 No
11111501 Well, then you should try it later
11111502 It&#39;s faint ... I think the scent remains
11111510 Okay
11111511 Somehow ... there was something like wood chips left
11111512 And a faint cherry blossom-like scent ...
11111513 Oh, did you think so too?
11111514 But that scent ... it&#39;s like cherry blossoms, it&#39;s a little different ...
11111515 Hmm ...
11111516 ………
11111517 What&#39;s wrong, the wolf
11111518 That scent ... somewhere nostalgic ...
11111519 Have you ever had a problem?
11111520 Probably ... but I can&#39;t remember
11111521 by the way…
11111522 Emma once said that there was a cherry tree behind the castle
11111523 It may be related
11111600 What remains in the incense burner seems to be a cherry tree
11111601 But it doesn&#39;t seem to be an ordinary cherry blossom
11111602 Emma may know something about the cherry blossoms that were blooming behind the castle.
11111700 The everlasting cherry blossoms have withered and aren&#39;t left ...
11111701 Okay
11111702 However, it is said that someone took away the branch of Tsunesakura by hand.
11111703 Hmm ... who does that
11111704 ………
11111705 ... what&#39;s lost can&#39;t be helped
11111706 Even if the branches were taken away, there are no clues now.
11111707 Let&#39;s collect other incense first
11111708 Yuyi
11111800 Huh ... I&#39;m sure I have to
11111801 Wolf ... I&#39;ve been investigating too.
11111802 I&#39;m sure this is ... the last incense ingredient you need
11111803 that is
11111804 The blood of the Son of the Dragon Seed ... In other words, my blood
11111805 Kuro-sama&#39;s blood ...
11111806 But it shouldn&#39;t flow
11111807 Ah ... that&#39;s what the Son of the Dragon Seed is.
11111808 However, I found a memoir of Kosho&#39;s Kosho in the room of Genichiro.
11111809 There seems to be some way to shed blood
11111810 Let&#39;s give this to you for the time being
11111850 By the way ... How did I find out how to shed my blood?
11111851 How about asking Emma?
11111852 Hmm ... If you&#39;re a pharmacist, is it bright for your body?
11111853 Certainly, it may be exactly what you say
11111900 Huh ... I&#39;m sure I have to
11111901 Wolf ... and how to shed my blood ... just find out
11111902 Emma, the pharmacist, may know something about how to shed my blood.
11111903 Will you ask Emma?
11112000 … Your child
11112001 Wow ...!
11112002 Oh, wolf ... I&#39;m sorry, it looks like I was sleeping
11112100 ………
11112101 Sue ... Sue ... Sue ...
11112102 Sue ... Sue ... Sue ...
11112103 Sue ... Sue ... Sue ...
11112104 Sue ... Sue ... Sue ...
11112105 Sue ... Sue ... Munya ...
11112106 …Hmm? What a wolf
11112107 Hua ...
11112108 I&#39;m glad you woke me up
11112109 Yomoya
11112200 is this…
11112201 The length is what was left
11112202 I think I was investigating the scent of the source to return to Senkyo.
11112203 The water that runs through this reed name and flows out of the source ...
11112204 It is written about the white flowers that bloom in the place where the water collects thickly.
11112205 Apparently it is one of the source incense
11112206 A place where the source water is thickly collected ...
11112207 Is it a deep canyon?
11112208 I see…. Then it might be Ochiya
11112209 The source water should also be flowing into that valley
11112210 ………
11112211 Hmm? What&#39;s wrong, the wolf?
11112212 Child, here
11112213 That white flower ...!
11112214 Was it blooming in the fall valley?
11112215 Yes, in the depths of the fall valley
11112216 Hmmm, that place was a place with a strong flow of water from the source
11112217 I don&#39;t think I already have it
11112218 Well done, wolf
11112300 Child, here
11112301 is this…
11112302 Is it the book written by the person who sought the incense of the source?
11112303 Okay
11112304 A village where fragrant stones are enshrined ...
11112305 But I&#39;ve never heard of such a village
11112306 ………
11112307 What&#39;s wrong, the wolf?
11112308 Hmm? The strangely shaped stone you have ...
11112309 Is it the source incense stone?
11112310 Haha
11112311 This stone was enshrined
11112312 Oh, that&#39;s exactly what the book says
11112313 Okay. On the altar where the stone was ...
11112314 Dedicated to the sword
11112315 Yes, it was written
11112316 Carrying ... Hmm
11112317 Where is it
11112318 It is a cave in the back of Iwato
11112319 Hmm ... From such a place ... Where are you going to get on your litter and get married?
11112320 Well, even if you think about it
11112321 I&#39;m sorry ...
11112322 Hmm?
11112323 Kuro-sama ... That place may be the entrance to Sengo.
11112324 ………Really
11112325 To be fragrant ... is to wear the scent of the source ...
11112326 I might be pointing to that
11112400 Child, here
11112401 is this…
11112402 Is it the book written by the person who sought the incense of the source?
11112403 Okay
11112404 A village where fragrant stones are enshrined ...
11112405 But I&#39;ve never heard of such a village
11112406 ………
11112407 What&#39;s wrong, the wolf?
11112408 Hmm? The strangely shaped stone you have ...
11112409 Is it the source incense stone?
11112410 Haha
11112411 This stone was enshrined
11112412 Oh, that&#39;s exactly what the book says
11112413 Okay. On the altar where the stone was ...
11112414 Dedicated to the sword
11112415 Yes, it was written
11112416 Carrying ... Hmm
11112417 Where is it
11112418 It is a cave in the back of Iwato
11112419 Hmm ... From such a place ... Where are you going to get on your litter and get married?
11112420 Well, even if you think about it
11112421 I&#39;m sorry ...
11112422 Hmm?
11112423 Kuro-sama ... That place may be the entrance to Sengo.
11112424 ………Really
11112425 To be fragrant ... is to wear the scent of the source ...
11112426 I might be pointing to that
11112427 Oh yeah
11112428 I&#39;ve been investigating too
11112429 I found the new incense I needed
11112430 that is
11112431 The blood of the Son of the Dragon Seed ... In other words, my blood
11112432 Kuro-sama&#39;s blood ...
11112433 But it shouldn&#39;t flow
11112434 Ah ... that&#39;s what the Son of the Dragon Seed is.
11112435 However, I found a memoir of Kosho&#39;s Kosho in the room of Genichiro.
11112436 There seems to be some way to shed blood
11112437 Let&#39;s give this to you for the time being
11112440 By the way ... How did I find out how to shed my blood?
11112441 How about asking Emma?
11112442 Hmm ... If you&#39;re a pharmacist, is it bright for your body?
11112443 Certainly, it may be exactly what you say
11120600 Oh ... that&#39;s right
11120601 Did you see the residual incense in the incense burner?
11120700 Shall we go
11120701 Wolf, I asked
11120702 Haha
11120800 By the way, the wolf ...
11120801 Emma said she would see Jo-sama&#39;s grave.
11120802 Something I want to check
11120803 …I understand
11120804 If it was the tomb of Jo-sama, it would have been behind this castle.
11140000 Thank you, wolf
11140001 It ’s a little hard for me
11140002 It ’s good.
11140100 good…
11140101 Huhhh ... yes, yes
11140200 Huh ... You&#39;re hiding and eating
11140201 Well, that&#39;s good too!
11140300 Kehokkehokkeho!
11140310 Hmmm, the dust is still terrible
11140320 I wonder how deadline this library was ...
11150000 Sue ... Sue ... Sue ...
11150001 Oh ... Kami ...
11150002 Difficulty ... Kake ... Munya ...
11150100 ………HM…
11150101 ...... Kushun ...
11150102 Hmm ... After all, it&#39;s dusty ...
11150103 Itchy nose, irresistible
11150200 Umm ... Umm, Umm ...
11150201 No more, if you can
11150202 Huh, let&#39;s do it, Kuro
11150300 Where ... the way ...
11150301 I wonder if it&#39;s gone ...
11150302 Genichiro-dono ...
11150400 ……… That guy…
11150401 I&#39;m strong ...
11150402 ……… I also want to be like this
11150500 And a little ...
11150501 ……… Um…
11150502 What to do ... until you do
11150503 ………
11250000 This is also Hirata
11250001 I have to mourn
11250002 Kuro-sama ...
11250003 Emma, who escaped from Hirata, what else?
11250004 Almost no more left
11250005 Is that so…
11250006 ... I&#39;m sorry
11250007 Those who aim for the dragon seeds are constantly ...
11250008 Hirata&#39;s people ... I got involved
11250100 I rejected it once
11250101 The army of the inner government is too powerful
11250102 Therefore, my blood ...
11250103 Do you use the power of the dragon seed?
11250104 No matter how much power you gain, forget about pain and fear, keep fighting, and so on ...
11250105 I ... I don&#39;t want to distort the way people live ...
11250106 Look at this corpse mountain
11250107 The reed name can no longer be protected by ordinary techniques.
11250108 (...!)
11250109 I can&#39;t be as strong as Genichiro
11250110 What to do ... I still don&#39;t know ...
11250111 … It&#39;s been a long time since then
11250112 It&#39;s no use waiting
11250200 Emma, what the heck is that ...
11250201 Kui Ruo Shui...
11250202 So called
11250203 Is that the secret plan of Ashina ...
11250204 Okay
11250205 What you drink will not die half a lifetime ... no, you will die
11250206 And weird water is also ...
11250207 The source is the dragon seed.
11250208 Okay
11250209 Emma, I don&#39;t think the dragon seed is precious
11160000 (Sound of grass whistle)
11160001 Kuro-sama ...
11160002 … It ’s a time limit, Emma
11160003 I know you&#39;re waiting for Genichiro
11160004 Return to the upper floor of the castle tower
11160005 ………
11160006 ……… Wolf
11160007 The reed leaf flute that blew at that time
11160008 This time you ...
11160009 Rely on the sound, surely come
12000000 Protagonist: Father-in-law ...
12000001 Owl: (... Gu) ... you ...?
12000002 Owl: This owl that took the unconsciousness ... is old ... (Guuuu ...!)
12000003 Owl: The allowance is good ... with this wound ... (Guu ...!) I can&#39;t help anymore ...
12000004 Owl: (Huhhh ...) More than that, it&#39;s a wolf ... this ...
12000020 is this…
12000021 The key to the hidden Buddhist temple in the mansion ...
12000022 Your child ... there ... in ...
12000023 But with this fire hand ... I can&#39;t enter from the front
12000024 (Huh) From outside the cliff
12000025 Well ...
12000026 Go outside from there, go along the cliff and wrap around from the reien ...
12000027 By the way, there is a loophole ...
12000028 I understand
12000029 Wolf, don&#39;t forget the law of ninja ...
12000030 Okay
12000031 The Lord is absolutely ...!
12000032 Wolf ... I&#39;ll bet my life and protect it ... I&#39;ll ... then ...
12000033 ... Gu ... Guha ...
12000034 Stepfather...
12000100 …………
12000101 Go out to your left and follow the cliff ...
12000102 If you go around from the reien, there is a loophole ...
12000103 Leave it to me, my father-in-law
12030700 With this fire hand ... Is it impossible from the front?
12030000 That day
12030001 A hungry wolf picked up on the battlefield ...
12030002 Well, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be this far
12030003 Stepfather
12030004 Really regrettable ...
12030005 But I&#39;ll cut it!
12030100 Hmm
12030101 Shinobi hands are a specialty of Buddhist priests ...
12030102 There are some strange things ...
12030200 Wolf, well, I&#39;ve polished this far
12030201 Take the reward
12030202 I&#39;ll show you my owl
12030400 Farewell…
12030401 Will you lose to me?
12030402 (Fuha) It&#39;s surprisingly comfortable ...
12030500 Farewell ... a hungry wolf
12100000 Stepfather...
12100001 Come alive ... was ...
12100002 Plot
12100003 I thought you were dead that night
12100004 With the help of your child, I returned from the dead
12100005 That&#39;s it
12100006 Is ...?
12100007 I&#39;m the power of that child ...
12100008 I&#39;m going to get a dragon seed
12100009 but…
12100010 ... I know
12100011 According to the first rule, my father commands it. Throw away the Lord
12100012 From now on, that Son is no longer your Lord
12100013 Throw away your child ...?
12100014 Well then, wolf ...
12100015 Follow your father&#39;s words and abandon your son
12100200 …Yuyi
12100201 According to my father&#39;s words, I abandon my son ... That&#39;s okay, isn&#39;t it?
12100300 ... I can&#39;t
12100301 I can&#39;t ... If that&#39;s the case, the ninja will be swept away
12100302 What a pity ...
12100303 Uuu…
12100500 …Okay. The law is absolute
12100501 Abandon the Lord ...
12100600 According to the first rule, my father commands it. Throw away the Lord
12100601 From now on, that Son is no longer your Lord
12100602 Throw away your child ...?
12100603 Well then, wolf ...
12100604 Follow your father&#39;s words and abandon your son
12100700 … After all, I can&#39;t
12100701 I can&#39;t ... If that&#39;s the case, the ninja will be swept away
12100702 What a pity ...
12100703 Uuu…
12130000 … Come on!
12130001 It&#39;s been a long time
12130002 Come on!
12130100 ... I&#39;m glad, wolf
12130101 Growing up well
12130200 One ...!
12130201 Parents are never allowed to go against
12130202 ... I can&#39;t protect you
12130300 Lid ...!
12130301 The Lord bets and protects his life, and if he is robbed, be sure to recover it.
12130302 … At this rate, it will be robbed again
12130400 Miitsu ...!
12130401 Fear is an absolute temporary defeat. But don&#39;t choose the means and be sure to take revenge
12130402 … Is it possible to take revenge?
12130500 Was Shosen a stray dog?
12160000 Well, wait!
12160200 Stupid!
12160800 Nuuuu!
12160900 Good luck!
12161000 Shadow cast
12161001 I&#39;ll give you back ...
12161002 Stunning ...
13000000 Hmm? ... a strange face
13000001 What&#39;s your name?
13000002 ………
13000003 Hmm, can&#39;t you call yourself?
13000004 However, I saw it as a ninja with an arm
13000005 If it&#39;s a ninja technique ... or ...
13000006 … Mu
13000007 ... forgive me
13000008 By all means, that is ...
13000009 Let&#39;s witness
13000100 Hmm ...
13000101 After all, I will die
13000200 The sword muscle of that place
13000201 It was wonderful
13000202 It&#39;s not the one who killed it so thoroughly
13000203 What is the Lord?
13000204 &quot;Don&#39;t die&quot;
13000205 Or, there is something called &quot;mushi possession&quot;
13000206 I&#39;m just here because I won&#39;t die
13000207 What are you doing at such a rough temple?
13000208 ………
13000209 ………HM
13000210 There are wrinkles between my eyebrows.
13000211 Forgive me
13000212 Why don&#39;t you use it to practice your sword?
13000213 … To fulfill your mission
13000214 Because it&#39;s a body that doesn&#39;t die, you can be cut many times
13000215 How is it?
13000250 Hmm ...
13000251 After all, I will die
13000252 The sword muscle of that place
13000253 It was wonderful
13000254 It&#39;s not the one who killed it so thoroughly
13000255 What is the Lord?
13000256 &quot;Don&#39;t die&quot;
13000257 Or, there is something called &quot;mushi possession&quot;
13000258 I&#39;m just here because I won&#39;t die
13000259 What are you doing at such a rough temple?
13000260 ………
13000261 ………HM
13000262 There are wrinkles between my eyebrows.
13000263 Forgive me
13000264 Why don&#39;t you use it to practice your sword?
13000265 … To fulfill your mission
13000266 Because it&#39;s a body that doesn&#39;t die, you can be cut many times
13000267 How is it?
13000300 Is that right?
13000301 Did you feel like it
13000302 Use it to practice your sword.
13000400 It&#39;s a practice with that, but it&#39;s time to try something that is more in line with the true battle.
13000401 That&#39;s what it is. Let&#39;s kill
13000402 It would be preferable as a training for that.
13000403 ………
13000404 what up?
13000405 Why do you give me that much?
13000406 Half bored
13000407 The other half ... That&#39;s right
13000408 ... I want to get rid of the wrinkles between my eyebrows.
13000409 I&#39;ll do it because it&#39;s good
13000600 Is that right?
13000601 Use it to practice your sword.
13000700 Let&#39;s go
13000701 Awareness
13000800 This time, it was a good meeting
13000801 It makes sense to be slashed ... it&#39;s surprisingly comfortable
13000802 But, forgive me, please adjust a little
13000803 It hurts every time
13001000 The big sword on the back of that place ...
13001001 What is it?
13001100 Finally die
13001101 I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m slashing my belly ... Finally ...
13001102 Will my resolution remain the same ...
13001103 Oh ... I want to be slashed there
13001104 … Awareness
13001105 Come on, do it!
13001200 (Guha ...!)
13001201 ………Farewell
13001300 Let&#39;s prepare for death by the time the next approval comes
13010000 I will come
13010100 I understand
13010101 Good, let&#39;s do it
13010102 If you swing your sword, you will be distracted.
13010200 turn down
13010201 Well, don&#39;t overdo it
13010202 I think it&#39;s boring
13010203 If you change your mind, tell me
13010300 I&#39;m sorry
13010301 Hahaha, jokingly, I hope you will continue to slash
13010302 Do you get it
13010303 Kuku ...
13010304 What?
13010305 That&#39;s &quot;Don&#39;t die&quot;
13010306 If it was useful for that, it might have made sense.
13010400 I can&#39;t stand
13010401 What? What?
13010402 I really feel that I was slashed after enduring the pain
13010403 Hahaha, cut it and thank you, etc.
13010404 Really?
13010405 Kuku ...
13010406 What?
13010407 That&#39;s &quot;Don&#39;t die&quot;
13010408 If it was useful for that, it might have made sense.
13010500 Did you feel like talking about the Ōdachi on your back?
13010501 What is it really
13010600 Forgive me ...
13010601 Did you feel like slashing that &quot;Don&#39;t die&quot;?
13010700 Immortal slash
13010701 What ...! Did it really fit
13010702 ... then, forgive me
13010703 Can you refuse my &quot;not dying&quot; with an immortal sword?
13010800 is this…
13010801 It&#39;s just a sword
13010802 (Huh ...) Is that true?
13010803 Oh, it&#39;s just a sword ...
13010804 ………Really
13010805 If it was a misunderstanding, please tell me
13010900 I know ...
13010901 ... I can&#39;t stand
13010902 Umm ...
13010903 If you have that skill, you can die without suffering.
13010904 No?
13010905 ... Oh, leave it to me
13010906 I have to give an example to the Buddhist priest
13010907 Let&#39;s prepare for death by the time the next approval comes
13011000 turn down
13011001 Jaga ...
13011002 turn down
13011003 ……Really
13011004 Don&#39;t force yourself
13011005 But if you feel compassion, ask
13011006 If you change your mind, always tell me
13001400 Forgive me ...
13001401 It seems that people who have lost their way gather at this company
13001402 Look, actually ... it&#39;s here ...
13001403 ………
13001404 That&#39;s why ...
13001405 Occasionally, something will flow into the money box there ...
13001500 It seems that people who have lost their way gather at this company
13001501 In fact, it&#39;s here ...
13001502 That&#39;s why ...
13001503 Occasionally, something will flow into the money box there ...
13020000 Also come
13020001 I will try as many techniques as I can.
13030000 Hmm ... As expected, that&#39;s right
13030100 It was good and witnessed
13030200 Um, wonderful
13030300 not yet
13030400 Once again, that&#39;s right
13030500 In addition, I will come
13030600 what up?
13030700 How was it, forgive me
13030800 Come on, that&#39;s right
13050000 Well, wait
13050001 Where it slashed ...
13050002 That will just get tired
14100200 Hmm ... That&#39;s why I was so tired.
14100201 I&#39;m totally persistent and disgusting ...
14100202 Hmm? Are you the people of Yataka?
14100203 …Disagreeable
14100204 Well, that&#39;s right. The taste is different
14100205 But apparently it&#39;s in the same industry
14100206 I&#39;m Mujina Kurokasa. What are you?
14100207 ………
14100208 Hey, unfriendly
14100209 A ninja on the top of the Buddha ...
14100210 The reeds also make noise outside
14100211 It&#39;s a really good day
14100212 … Lord, shinobi?
14100213 Well, that&#39;s the place
14100214 By the way, I need some money ...
14100215 There are goods, but I can&#39;t handle them.
14100216 I&#39;ve been waiting for you guys
14100300 Hmm ... this roost is in good shape
14100301 From one to the next, there are many customers
14100302 ... Well, if you&#39;re a customer who drops money, you&#39;re welcome
14100400 Yo, you
14100401 Do you need something again?
14100500 Hmm? It&#39;s about time the store is closed
14100600 Gu ... ha ...
14100601 badger…
14100602 You ...
14100603 ... I&#39;m sorry, if there are too many mice
14100604 Well then, it&#39;s springing up ...
14100605 I was scared of my heart
14100606 Thanks to you ...
14100607 What happened
14100608 The mice are ... trying to slash even the little kid ...
14100609 Hmm ...
14100610 Help the kid ... This is Zama
14100611 I wonder if Mujina of Kurokasa also turned around.
14100612 ………
14100613 Heh ... hehe ...
14100614 I don&#39;t want to thank you ...
14100615 My corpse ...
14100616 Hmm ... I&#39;m gonna give you ... I&#39;m ... how ...
14110100 According to my view ...
14110101 You know, this iron fan will look good on you
14110102 With this guy, with an arrow or a gun ...
14110103 What if it ’s a large cylinder, somehow
14110200 Hmm ... do you know
14110201 A mouse from the outside should come to this reed castle.
14110202 Such a mouse ...
14110203 There&#39;s an old man who slashes with grasshoppers
14110210 I don&#39;t know
14110211 That&#39;s right
14110212 There was a guy called Onigatabu, Otemon ...
14110213 Beside that, there is a turret on the side of Jaya
14110214 Maybe the old man is there
14110215 Very detailed
14110216 Died, hey
14110217 That old man ...
14110218 It&#39;s suspicious whether you can distinguish between a mouse and Mujina.
14110220 Is it the face of a tengu?
14110221 Oh, did you see that too?
14110222 Oh i talked
14110223 Hmm ... That&#39;s a surprise
14110224 Good, the neck is still connected
14120300 I&#39;ll be here until I have some money
14120301 If you feel like it, please stop by again
14120400 Bye
14120500 By the way ...
14120501 Thanks to you, I&#39;ve saved a lot of money
14120502 It ’s enough to get ready
14120503 I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going
14120504 Where
14120505 Senmine Temple on Mt. Kongo
14120506 Recently, there are many mice in this area.
14120507 It&#39;s getting smelly
14120508 A little bit, I&#39;m done with the wilderness
14120600 At Senmine-ji Temple, I finished a little bit of wildlife
14120601 You are also a master
14160000 Wow!
14160100 Gya!
14160200 Yeah!
14160300 Yeah, stupid!
14160400 Good grief…
14160401 The trouble is that it&#39;s gone
14160500 Jeez…
14160501 Don&#39;t bother me, hey
14160600 Gua ah ...
14160601 This, yeah ... uh ...
14200000 Hmm? Did you come to this temple too?
14200001 You are…?
14200002 Hey, you said it was for Yabo
14200003 What are you doing here
14200004 Over there ... I crossed over to the other side, but I was stuck
14200005 How to cross the opposite bank?
14200006 Use a ninja kite Hi, don&#39;t cross
14200007 However, if you are a kite-raising amateur who has the knack to keep the kite up all the time, the load is heavy.
14200008 Really…
14200009 Below the cliff, there is a kite-raising clerk.
14200010 Let him raise a kite all the time ...
14200011 Under the sleeves, it doesn&#39;t work at all
14200030 Hmm? Are you a ninja?
14200031 ………
14200032 Hmm ... can&#39;t you answer?
14200033 But apparently it&#39;s in the same industry
14200034 I&#39;m Kurokasa Mujina
14200035 The area around the castle of Ashina is a roost ...
14200036 I came to this temple for wildlife
14200037 What are you?
14200038 ………
14200039 Hey, unfriendly
14200040 What are you doing here
14200041 Over there ... I crossed over to the other side, but I was stuck
14200042 How to cross the opposite bank?
14200043 Use a ninja kite Hi, don&#39;t cross
14200044 However, if you are a kite-raising amateur who has the knack to keep the kite up all the time, the load is heavy.
14200045 Really…
14200046 Below the cliff, there is a kite-raising clerk.
14200047 Let him raise a kite all the time ...
14200048 Under the sleeves, it doesn&#39;t work at all
14200060 Hmm? Did you come to this temple too?
14200061 You are…?
14200062 Hey, you said it was for Yabo
14200070 Hmm? Are you a ninja?
14200071 ………
14200072 Hmm ... can&#39;t you answer?
14200073 But apparently it&#39;s in the same industry
14200074 I&#39;m Kurokasa Mujina
14200075 The area around the castle of Ashina is a roost ...
14200076 I came to this temple for wildlife
14200077 What are you?
14200078 ………
14200079 Hey, unfriendly
14200100 Over there ... I&#39;ve crossed over to the other side ...
14200101 Below the cliff, there is a kite-raising clerk.
14200102 Let him raise a kite all the time ...
14200200 Hmm ... What is the art of puppet?
14200201 I saw it for the first time
14200202 You know, don&#39;t you do it?
14200203 ………
14200204 Hey, one of my favorite faces
14200205 With this, I can also finish the wilderness
14200206 Thank you
14200300 Hmm ... I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m a puppeteer
14200301 Now you can use a kite to cross the other side
14200302 Thank you
14200400 Hmm ... what are you doing
14200401 The kite that was up ...
14200500 Yeah, you
14200501 Did you finish the field use?
14200502 Oh, thanks
14200503 ... this grave
14200504 This guy, my ... kid&#39;s grave
14200505 Really…
14200506 After the kid is gone ...
14200507 Suddenly, Rappa&#39;s responsibility has become troublesome.
14200508 It&#39;s a trial of weirdness, a kidnapping, Kurokasa&#39;s duty ...
14200509 This temple is troublesome
14200510 So did you miss it?
14200511 …Oh
14200512 By the way ... This is the end of the field use
14200513 I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going back to the castle of Ashina.
14200514 No matter where it is, it ’s better than this temple.
14200600 By the way ... Thanks to you, I&#39;m done with the wilderness
14200601 I wonder if I will return to the castle of Ashina little by little.
14200602 Oh, by the way
14200603 You may know ...
14200604 The reed name is now ... It&#39;s supposed to smell like Kina.
14200605 The number of mice coming in is also unusual.
14200606 ………
14200607 You too, be careful
14210000 ………
14210001 At all ... I managed to finish it for the wilderness ...
14210100 The old woman was saying
14210101 &quot;Kite-raising with a puppeteer&quot;
14210102 ... the old ladies?
14210103 What they say is not stupid
14210104 Yeah ...
14210105 There is a technique to manipulate creatures like a puppet in the art of ninja ...
14210106 It might be that one
14900000 (Zehi, Zehi, Zehi ...)
14900100 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...)
14900200 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Gohogoho)
14901000 Zehi ... Zehi ...
14901001 Is it sick ...
14901002 Zehi ... Zehi ...
14901003 Hmm ... totally ... it&#39;s a hassle ...
14901010 Zehi ... Zehi ...
14901011 Dragon cough ...
14901012 Zehi ... Zehi ...
14901013 Hmm ... totally ... it&#39;s a hassle ...
14901050 Zehi ... Zehi ...
14901051 Hmm ... totally ... it&#39;s a hassle ...
14901100 Drink ...
14901101 U ... Gollum ...
14901102 Ah ...
14901103 This will cure
14901104 At best ... at best ... at best ...
14901105 Hmm ... with Mujina-sama of Kurokasa ...
14901106 Take care, sorry
14901150 At best ... at best ... at best ...
14901151 Hmm ... with Mujina-sama of Kurokasa ...
14901152 Take care, sorry
14901200 ………
14901201 Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...
14901300 I&#39;ll get blood
14901301 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Gohogoho)
14901310 … To Emma
14901400 Yo, you
14901401 I was taken care of the other day
14901402 It was a troublesome illness, but ...
14901403 Thanks, I&#39;m gonna pin it
15000000 Uh ... Uh ...
15000010 Ah ... ah ...
15000100 Uh ... Uh ...
15010000 Why cry
15010001 (Uh ...) I&#39;m sad
15010002 What&#39;s sad
15010003 Mr. Sakuza, where are you going now?
15010004 It ’s sad that I do n’t understand it.
15010005 I want to know at least even if I can&#39;t meet
15010006 But ...
15010007 Even if I write a letter, I will not come back
15010008 No one tells me where I am
15010009 Hey, Onito ...
15010010 Is Mr. Sakuzako Izuko?
15010100 I don&#39;t know
15010101 Oh ... you too are a liar ...
15010102 Why do you guys hide
15010200 ………
15010201 Ah ... you too ...
15010202 Why do you guys hide
15010300 ………
15010301 Uh ... Uh ...
15030000 Oh!
15030001 Oh ... you too ...
15030002 You hide Sakuza-sama, right?
15030100 Oh, Mr. Sakuza ...
15030101 If you don&#39;t come
15030102 At least instead ...
15030200 Oh ... it was good
15030201 Mr. Sakuza ... Instead, he moved in ...
15030202 You&#39;re there ...
15030300 Why hide
15060300 Do you pretend not to see ...
15060301 Oh ... you too ...
15060302 You hide Sakuza-sama, right?
15060400 Uhhh ...
16000000 Oh ... Chojuro?
16000001 Didn&#39;t you see the young man?
16000100 Not a kid
16000101 Inosuke, also such
16000102 You said that something went wrong ... I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to make a mistake.
16000103 … Hmm, well good
16000104 Let&#39;s entrust this bell to you
16000105 It ’s a guard bell that I made with the young people in mind.
16000106 Offer this guard bell to the Buddha
16000200 ………
16000201 Why don&#39;t you keep silent?
16000202 Does it hurt in the stomach? You&#39;ve always been easy to get hungry
16000203 … Hmm, well good
16000204 Let&#39;s entrust this bell to you
16000205 It ’s a guard bell that I made with the young people in mind.
16000206 Offer this guard bell to the Buddha
16000300 Inosuke, my dad
16000301 Did the guard bell offer to the Buddha?
16000302 You see, there&#39;s a ruined temple with a biased Buddhist priest
16000303 If you ’re a Buddha, do n’t be there.
16000400 Inosuke, my dad
16000401 Did the guard bell offer to the Buddha?
16000402 Oh
16000403 Oh, I&#39;m a machete ... You&#39;re still a kind child
16030000 What ...
16030100 Hii
16030200 Stop ...!
16100000 (Hi ...) Owl&#39;s sword ...
16100001 I saw something terrifying ...
16100002 It will spring up!
16100003 From the next, to the next ... endlessly sac, Domedo ...! Good!
16100004 Young ... Young is in the back of the mansion ...
16100005 I think it&#39;s safe because Chojuro headed for me ...
16100006 Stealth, just in case, go to save the young man
16100100 (Hi ...) It&#39;s scary ... It springs up and doesn&#39;t stop ...
16100101 Wow, young man is in the back of the mansion
16100102 Stealth, save the young man
16130000 After all ... Unura parent and child ...
16900000 (Zehi, Zehi, Zehi ...)
16900100 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...)
16900200 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Gohogoho)
16900300 Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...
16900301 Is this ... sick?
16900302 Zehi ... Zehi ...
16900303 Zehi ... Inosuke ... Inosuke ...
16900304 ………
16900305 Waka ... sama ...
16900306 Zehi ... Amulet ... I&#39;m gonna ...
16900307 ………
16900308 I beg you ... I&#39;m ... it depends on you ...
16900400 Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...
16900401 Dragon cough ...
16900402 Zehi ... Zehi ...
16900403 Zehi ... Inosuke ... Inosuke ...
16900404 …Okay
16900405 Waka ... sama ...

16900450 Waka ... sama ...
16900451 Zehi ... Amulet ... I&#39;m gonna ...
16900452 I beg you ... I&#39;m ... it depends on you ...
16900500 Oh ... Inosuke ...
16900501 Thank you ... I feel better breathing
16900502 With a filial son ...
16900503 My mother ... Uh ... I&#39;m really happy ...
16900504 ………
16900600 Oh, Inosuke
16900601 I don&#39;t know anyone ...
16900602 The one over there is coughing all the time
16900603 I&#39;m worried
16900700 The cough over there ... seems to have healed
16900701 Fufufu ... Inosuke
16900702 My mother saw you taking the medicine
16900703 With a compassionate son ...
16900704 My mother ... Uh ... Makoto, I have a high nose
16900800 I&#39;ll get blood
16900801 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Gohogoho)
16900810 … To Emma
16910000 this…
16910001 Zehi ... Inosuke ... Is that ...?
16910002 ... is a medicine
16910003 Zehi ... Thank you ... Thank you ...
16910004 U ... Gollum ...
16910005 Ah ...
16910006 Soon ... it will get better
16910007 At best ... at best ... at best ...
16910008 You are ...
16910009 …Okay
16910010 Takayuki ... My son ...
16910011 ………
16910050 At best ... at best ... at best ...
16910051 You are ...
16910052 Takayuki ... My son ...
16910100 ………
16910101 Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...
16910102 Oh ... Waka, sama ...
17001000 : Oh ... it&#39;s a familiar face
17001001 :………Oh
17001002 : Shinobi&#39;s husband!
17001003 : No, since that night
17001010 : Oh ... it&#39;s a familiar face
17001011 And then ... I feel like an angry face ...
17001012 :………Oh
17001013 : Shinobi&#39;s husband!
17001014 : No, since that night
17001100 Well, my husband, I&#39;m glad I was safe
17001101 Since that night
17001200 Husband, I&#39;ve been waiting!
17001201 I bought the goods with the money I received.
17001202 Come on, buy it
17001300 Maid, my husband!
17001301 Come on, buy it
17001400 Yo, my husband
17001401 I understand what the samurai are looking for
17001402 Really, my husband!
17001403 Oh, I don&#39;t seem to have enough salt
17001404 I see, salt ...
17001405 Not only to eat, but also to cleanse the dead and injure ...
17001406 If the corpse rots on the battlefield, it makes sense for the epidemic.
17001407 Everyone is in trouble because there is no salt ...
17001408 Uh ... that guy ...
17001409 It&#39;s time to make money!
17001410 ………
17001411 By the way, there are many people who can be saved if there is salt. Even if you sell it at a slightly higher price, the drumstick will not hit.
17001412 If so, I have to work on salt
17001413 Thank you husband
17001500 Now, how did you make the salt?
17001501 Oh, husband, is it easy to buy something?
17001600 Husband, listen
17001601 The salt sold well
17001602 Thanks to that, I have a lot of money and I have a lot of purchases!
17001603 Come on, come on, buy new items as well.
17001700 Husband, your connoisseur is the best!
17001701 I brought a nice guy
17001702 Besides being powerful, I&#39;m willing to catch corpses ...
17001703 Thanks to that, I have a lot of armor and I can make a lot of money!
17001704 Of course, I bought new items as well.
17001705 Please take a look
17001800 Husband ... haha ... how are you ...?
17001801 ………what up
17001802 No ... I&#39;m here ...
17001803 The guys in the Uchifu ... Hey, I can&#39;t talk to you ...
17001804 Money and goods ... Bring everything ...
17001805 But Kotaro ... turned me back ...
17001806 Hey, buddy!
17001807 ………
17001808 ... Hehe, Kotaro&#39;s guy, fall asleep
17001809 ……… Oh, I&#39;m sleeping well
17001810 Such a face ... Don&#39;t do it ...
17001811 Nothing, my husband is depressed, I don&#39;t think
17001812 ………
17001813 That&#39;s right ... Husband ...
17001814 For my husband ... I saved one good item
17001815 The last item ...
17001816 If you like ... Would you like to buy it?
17001900 Oh! Hey, my husband!
17001901 ………what up
17001902 ……e? that?
17001903 Hmm ...
17001904 It&#39;s funny, I don&#39;t know what it is, but when I saw my husband&#39;s face, I suddenly got irritated.
17001905 I&#39;m sorry, take a second look ...
17001906 Well, husband, please buy it
17010800 What is that night
17010801 …Hmm? Husband, don&#39;t you remember
17010802 Oh
17010803 Hmm ...
17010804 I see ... I don&#39;t remember ... Hmm ...
17010805 ... Hey, my husband
17010806 I have met you
17010807 At that time, I was a thief
17010808 Then I washed my feet and started selling things.
17010809 But there is no money
17010810 I don&#39;t have money, so I don&#39;t have any goods
17010811 So my husband, could you just use a little ridiculous money for me?
17010812 With that as a starting point, it will surely be easy for your husband to purchase useful items.
17010813 Then, as a bonus ... Let&#39;s talk about &quot;that night&quot;
17010814 How is it, bad story, hey?
17010900 ………
17010901 Husband, it seems that he escaped safely, congratulations
17011000 It&#39;s money
17011001 Hehe, husband, thank you
17011002 Talk to me
17011003 Oh, of course
17011004 That night ...
17011005 They broke into Hirata&#39;s mansion
17011006 As you know, Hirata is a branch of Ashina, a tiny bandit, usually a revenge.
17011007 However, most of the young samurai who had been in the previous battle had paid off.
17011008 Aiming at that, I broke in and then ... I lit it and robbed it
17011009 In the middle of that, I met my husband
17011010 My husband was looking for something ... that&#39;s how it looked
17011011 That&#39;s what I know
17011012 ………Really
17011013 …Oh
17011014 That night, I just made that kind of face
17011015 Are you still looking for something?
17011016 ………
17011017 ... Hey, my husband
17011018 I may be able to tell you something else you would like to know if you can afford it.
17011019 Please buy the information.
17011050 I may be able to tell you something else you would like to know if you can afford it.
17011051 Please buy the information.

17011101 Oh ... that&#39;s a shame
17011102 Well, if you change your mind, please call me
17011103 It shouldn&#39;t be a bad story for me or my husband
17011200 Did you change your mind, husband?
17011201 I wish I could use the money ...
17011202 With that as a starting point, it will surely be easy for your husband to purchase useful items.
17011203 Then, as a bonus ... Let&#39;s talk about &quot;that night&quot;
17011204 How is it, bad story, hey?
17011300 Buy information
17011301 Thank you for your purchase!
17011302 Eh ... what a ninja my husband is
17011303 Let me give you information on the ninja tools
17011304 ask
17011305 Ah, it&#39;s easy to see &quot;a cylinder that catches fire with great momentum&quot;
17011306 When the Hirata mansion broke in, my friends were bundling.
17011307 Bo ...! Bo ...!
17011308 I blew the fire with great momentum.
17011350 &quot;Cylinder with fire&quot; is in Hirata Mansion ...
17011351 Let&#39;s remember
17011370 …have
17011371 e…
17011372 If it&#39;s a cylinder that catches fire, I have it
17011373 Ah ... that&#39;s a shame
17011374 Hehe ... Don&#39;t be afraid, let&#39;s give this one as a bonus
17011700 Buy information
17011701 Maid, my husband!
17011702 Eh ... Another piece of information about ninja tools.
17011703 It&#39;s easy for someone with whom I have a relationship to talk about &quot;firecrackers that make a loud noise.&quot;
17011704 Hey, a grave-fishing merchant
17011705 Where is the merchant&#39;s store
17011706 The landmark of that shop is the ginkgo tree on the cliff.
17011707 Grave-fishers, easy to hide and do business
17011708 It&#39;s not a decent business ...
17011709 Okay, let&#39;s remember
17011710 The information is now sold out every time, my husband
17011800 Buy information
17011801 Maid, my husband!

17011810 e…
17011811 If you&#39;re a merchant on that cliff, you know
17011812 Ah ... There is such a thing, isn&#39;t it?
17011813 Hehe ... Don&#39;t be afraid, let&#39;s give this one a bonus
17011820 Well ... the information is now sold out and every time, my husband
17011900 It&#39;s money
17011901 Hehe, husband, thank you
17011902 Talk to me
17011903 Oh, of course
17011904 That night ...
17011905 They broke into Hirata&#39;s mansion
17011906 As you know, Hirata is a branch of Ashina, a tiny bandit, usually a revenge.
17011907 However, most of the young samurai who had been in the previous battle had paid off.
17011908 Aiming at that, I broke in and then ... I lit it and robbed it

17011912 ………Really
17011913 ... Hey, my husband
17011914 I may be able to tell you something else you would like to know if you can afford it.
17011915 Please buy the information.
17012000 Ah, my husband ... I don&#39;t seem to have enough money
17020300 Easy to purchase goods with the money you received
17020301 Husband, please look forward to it
17020400 By the way, my husband, please ask me
17020401 Oh
17020402 It&#39;s easy to think that you want to make your business bigger
17020403 I don&#39;t know when this reed name will perish ... it&#39;s a sinking boat
17020404 ... In other words, I think it&#39;s an opportunity to come up.
17020405 Therefore, there is one request
17020406 What
17020407 Why don&#39;t the samurai of Ashina find out what they want now?
17020408 If you know that, you can easily trade with the Samurai of Ashina.
17020409 Husband is a ninja
17020410 You should have good ears to get information from the enemy
17020411 By all means, easy to ask
17020500 Well then, my husband
17020501 Please come again
17020600 Well then, my husband
17020601 What the reed samurai want now
17020602 If you know that, let me know
17020700 Well then, my husband
17020701 If salt sells well, it&#39;s easy to buy new products
17020702 At that time, please patronize!
17020800 Oh my husband, listen
17020801 Is it a business story?
17020802 As expected, my husband, it ’s good to guess.
17020803 Hi, I&#39;ve been dying lately ... It&#39;s easy to smell the war
17020804 If it happens during this period, I think I can make another profit.
17020805 Therefore, it is easy to ask your husband
17020806 What
17020807 Manpower for battlefield fishing
17020808 I want it
17020809 Corpses are still easy to roll around on the battlefield
17020810 Well, if you catch a treasure trove, you can get all-you-can-eat spears, swords, and armor helmets.
17020811 When you&#39;re ready for battle, let&#39;s sell your armor like a fly
17020812 What kind of manpower do you want
17020813 Well ... Battlefield fishing is a dirty job and a hard job
17020814 Easy to ask for one big and powerful one
17020900 Well then, my husband
17020901 I&#39;ll ask for manpower for battlefield fishing.
17020902 Easy to ask for a big and powerful guy
17021000 Thanks to my husband, my business is a climbing dragon
17021001 It may not be long before I become a merchant of Ashina Ichi.
17021002 If your husband is in trouble, let&#39;s hire him
17021003 turn down
17021004 Hehe, a person who can&#39;t get along
17021005 Well, my husband, please come again
17021100 Maido ...
17021101 The last item ...
17021102 I hid it in the loincloth ... I might smell it ... Hey, please forgive me ...
17021103 It&#39;s fine
17021104 Now ... sold out ... the store is closed
17021105 But ... I&#39;m sorry.
17021106 This coin is here
17021107 Oh…
17021108 I&#39;m ... With this one coin, I&#39;ll hit a mountain
17021109 Oh…
17021110 Husband ... Then, again ... buy ...
17021200 Hehe ... My husband ...
17021201 The purse string ...
17030800 Gua!
17030900 Gya!

17100200 Husband, are you also a firefighting thief?
17100201 ………
17100202 My husband is a ninja who saw it ... Isn&#39;t he looking for something?
17100203 Well, anyway, this is the place I found earlier
17100204 Get away from me
17100205 ………
17100206 ……… Ah, by the way
17100207 On the way to this mansion, I saw a three-storied pagoda on some cliff.
17100208 That&#39;s a magnificent tower
17100209 I&#39;m sure there are treasures inside, but it&#39;s no different
17100210 If so, it&#39;s easy to think so
17100300 Hey, my husband
17100301 On the way to this mansion, I saw a three-storied pagoda on some cliff.
17100302 That&#39;s a magnificent tower
17100303 I&#39;m sure there are treasures inside, but it&#39;s no different
17100304 If so, it&#39;s easy to think so
17130000 I don&#39;t like the slashed stretch ...
17130001 I can&#39;t help it
17130100 Good grief…
17130101 I want you to calm down and let me rush

17900203 Thank you

22001413 A person with a false dragon seed created by undying seekers.
22001414 ... what are the children?
22001415 I was the only one who grew up properly
22001416 Everyone else ... sleeping here
22001417 Really
22001418 I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s right to cut off immortality
22001419 However, the dragon seed distorts the way people live ...

22002105 And it was very good
22002106 Fufu ... That was good
22002107 ……Oh, I see
22002108 The Son of the Dragon Seed is also ... a person, isn&#39;t it?
22002109 What a matter of course ...
22002110 I&#39;m sure I&#39;m immortal ... so I&#39;m at a loss ...
22002111 Still, it must have been chosen
22002112 My son&#39;s ninja, I&#39;d like to hear one ...
22002113 What
22002114 What is your child&#39;s name?

22002116 Kuro-sama ... Very good sound ...

22002151 Oh
22002152 Your child used the rice you received as a rice cake
22002153 Well ... the Son of the Dragon Seed does such a thing by himself ...
22002154 I was very enthusiastic
22002155 Well ... that&#39;s right
22002156 ……Oh, I see
22002157 The Son of the Dragon Seed is also ... a person, isn&#39;t it?
22002158 What a matter of course ...
22002159 I&#39;m sure I&#39;m immortal ... so I&#39;m at a loss ...
22002160 Still, it must have been chosen
22002161 My son&#39;s ninja, I&#39;d like to hear one ...
22002162 What
22002163 What is your child&#39;s name?
22002164 Kuro-sama
22002165 Kuro-sama ... Very good sound ...
22002166 I want to see you someday
22002200 Everyone ... what should I do ...
22002201 When immortality is achieved ...
22002202 I also ... lose something important ...
22002203 I feel like that
22002400 I ... I don&#39;t want to lose them
22002401 ………
22002402 But ... the way to return the dragon seed ... if you choose it ...
22002403 Maybe we&#39;ll break up with everyone
22002404 ………
22002405 You say that ...
22002406 ………
22002407 Huff ... No, everyone ...
22002408 That person is ... really kind
22002409 He gave me this ...
22002410 Hey
22002411 Oh, the ninja of your child ... You were here
22002412 Thanks to that, I was able to talk deeply with my friends.
22002413 Weird children, or
22002414 Okay
22002415 … So I have something to tell you
22002416 Instead of cutting off the dragon seed ... About the way to return it to where it should be
22002417 Return the dragon seed?
22002418 That&#39;s right
22002419 The dragon seed is ... The one that left home and arrived in Japan
22002420 Where it shouldn&#39;t be, there&#39;s something it shouldn&#39;t be
22002421 Therefore, there will be no end to those who try to create a distorted life like ours.
22002422 The dragon seeds and those of us who are connected to the dragon seeds ... I&#39;m sure we should go home.
22002423 To the west ... To the hometown of the god dragon ...
22002424 But how do you get there ... I still don&#39;t know
22002425 Those who know the certainty
22002426 If you are a Senmine Shonin, or
22002427 Who is it
22002428 This is the founder of Senmine-ji Temple. How old are you?
22002429 It is kept in the womb
22002430 Shinobi of the Son
22002431 What
22002432 This is ... a different path from immortality
22002433 Therefore, I do not say that it is impossible
22002434 If you want a way to return the dragon seed, would you please ask Senmine Shonin how to do it?
22002435 … Let&#39;s think
22002500 Shinobi of the Son
22002501 If you want a way to return the dragon seed, would you please ask Senmine Shonin how to do it?
22002502 That person is in a five-storied pagoda at the end of the womb.
22002600 Shinobi of the Son
22002601 Did you come to meet Senmine Shonin?
22002602 Was dead
22002603 Senmine Shonin is possessed by bugs ... Why is that happening ...
22002604 However, the book remained. this
22002605 take a look
22002606 ………
22002607 ………I see
22002608 If you eat two snake persimmons, you can become a cradle that holds the son of a dragon.
22002609 Then you can return the dragon seed to your hometown ...
22002610 ………I…
22002611 That cradle, let me be
22002612 … Lord, did you read it for sure?
22002613 of course
22002614 ………
22002615 I am ... the only survivor of the strange son
22002616 Don&#39;t die in half a lifetime
22002617 Shinobi of the Son
22002618 If you want a way to return the dragon seed, bring two snake persimmons
22002619 Do you have any idea
22002620 Probably the liver that can be taken from the big snake
22002621 It is said to be dyed red like a persimmon

22012003 When the immortal contract of Ryusei is not made ...
22012004 Something that remains in exchange

22030700 This Senmine-ji Temple is now a place that deviates from the teachings of the Buddha.
22030701 Everyone was fascinated by the quest to be a monk
22030702 If you become a captive, you don&#39;t know what to do
22030703 It ’s better to go home
22030704 ………

23000302 Who is the Lord ...
23000303 Ashina Isshin
23000304 ...!
23000305 I am a pharmacist who serves Isshin
23000306 Why ... I was ordered to help
23000307 Isshin does not want the power of the dragon seed
23000308 Therefore, Kuro-sama ...
23000309 I tried to escape from the reed name
23000310 Okay
23000311 A sentence to the bottom of the well ... Is that also the Lord?
23000312 That&#39;s right
23000313 However, my responsibility is so far ...
23000314 You should have someone to meet first
23000315 Kuro is downstairs
23000400 You should have someone to meet first
23000401 Kuro is downstairs

23000501 Oh
23000502 Just a little ...
23000503 I think the wrinkles between the eyebrows have become thinner
23000504 ………
23000505 Your child wants to meet Isshin
23000506 My Lord is resting in this tower outside the castle tower.
23000507 However, Isshin-sama is a little sloppy ... Therefore, the separation is closed.
23000550 It seems that you talked with Kuro-sama
23000551 Oh
23000552 Just a little ...
23000553 I think the wrinkles between the eyebrows have become thinner
23000560 Your child wants to meet Isshin
23000561 My Lord is resting in this tower outside the castle tower.
23000562 However, Isshin-sama is a little sloppy ... Therefore, the separation is closed.
23000600 My Lord is resting in this tower outside the castle tower.
23000601 Isshin-sama is a little sloppy ... Therefore, the separation is closed.
23000700 (Fu ...) It seems that Isshin-sama wasn&#39;t there.
23000701 Oh. But there was this
23000702 ………HM
23000703 Otemon, where you fought against Onigata-sama ...
23000704 Beside that, there is a turret on the side of Jaya
23000705 Why don&#39;t you go there?
23000800 Isshin-sama was not in the turret
23000801 The battlefield where you fought against Onigata-sama ...
23000802 Beside that, there is a turret on the side of Jaya

23000901 Thanked
23000902 To slash Genichiro-den ...
23000903 Is that so…
23000904 Genichiro-dono, no way, you&#39;re drinking strange young starch ...
23000905 What is it
23000906 Among the weird waters, the ones that are particularly thick are called so.
23000907 You have seen it too
23000908 Those who have eaten the weird starch ...
23000909 Transforms into a body that is strong enough to withstand the slashing that should be dead
23000910 That was originally investigated by my teacher, Dogen.
23000911 I heard that the books and medicines I looked up were burned and thrown away ...
23000912 It seems that some of my brothers had brought it out
23000913 ...... Mostly around the directions
23000914 ………
23000915 Kuro-sama ... What are your thoughts?
23000916 heard
23000917 do it?
23000918 Both will try to be immortal
23000919 Is that so…

23000923 Please speak to me anytime
23000924 Help as a pharmacist
23001000 Mainly, I have something to ask
23001001 Yes what
23001002 About the cherry blossoms behind the castle
23001003 It&#39;s about everlasting cherry blossoms
23001004 It ’s a cherry blossom that Jo-sama brought from his hometown.
23001005 In other words, is it the cherry blossoms of Sengo?
23001006 Yes, that is a mysterious cherry blossom ...
23001007 It was always in bloom, not only in spring
23001008 but…. There are no everlasting cherry trees or flowers anymore
23001009 Withered
23001010 Why withered
23001011 Some people broke the branches and took away the flowers.
23001012 The everlasting cherry blossoms that lost their flowers eventually died.
23001013 The everlasting cherry tree itself has been lost.
23001100 Tsunezakura brought from his hometown by Mr. Takeshi ...
23001101 Some people broke the branches and took away the flowers.
23001102 The everlasting cherry blossoms that lost their flowers eventually died.

23001205 What are you saying…
23001206 this…
23001210 Is it the one left behind ...
23001211 It is written there
23001212 To make an immortality, it&#39;s not just the tears of a dragon
23001213 The blood of the Son of the Dragon Seed needs to be drained
23001214 Shed blood ... that is
23001215 Okay. Will die
23001216 However, your child&#39;s blood should not flow
23001217 Okay. If it&#39;s the usual way
23001218 But you have a way to do that
23001219 … Is it an immortal sword?
23001220 Okay
23001221 Immortal sword is a sword that kills even those who do not die
23001222 That terrifying power will also kill your child
23001223 ………
23001224 I ... I don&#39;t want to choose that path
23001225 The way to not kill Kuro-sama ...

23001260 Okay
23001261 Immortal sword is a sword that kills even those who do not die
23001262 That terrifying power will also kill your child

23001265 The way to not kill Kuro-sama ...
23001266 I want to find it
23001300 Do you know your child?
23001301 That immortality leads to my own death
23001302 From what you saw ... I&#39;m sure it is.
23001303 The record left by Mr. Takeshi was originally on the bookshelf
23001304 Kuro was enthusiastic about reading books on the bookshelf.
23001305 You should also be aware of the meaning of the word kaishakunin.
23001306 …Wolf Hall
23001307 After all, I can&#39;t give up
23001308 The way not to kill Kuro-sama ...

23002601 It doesn&#39;t seem to be time to give it to you yet
23002602 Please come again when you have mastered the mystery
23002603 Do you get it
23002700 Excuse me. Alcohol is now ...
23002800 I have something to ask the Lord
23002801 Yes what
23002802 It ’s a way to shed your child ’s blood.
23002803 ... why do you want it?
23002804 Get the tears of a dragon in Senkyo
23002805 Fulfill immortality
23002806 For that, there is the blood of the child.
23002807 …Is that so
23002808 Certainly, the blood of the Son of the Dragon Seed does not flow in the usual way.
23002809 But you have a way to do that
23002810 … Is it an immortal sword?
23002811 Okay
23002812 Here
23002820 I have something to ask the Lord
23002821 Yes what
23002822 It ’s a way to shed your child ’s blood.
23002823 ... why do you want it?
23002824 Get the tears of a dragon in Senkyo
23002825 Fulfill immortality
23002826 For that, there is the blood of the child.
23002827 …Is that so
23002828 Certainly, the blood of the Son of the Dragon Seed does not flow in the usual way.
23002829 However, there is something to do that at Senmineji Temple.
23002830 … Is it an immortal sword?
23002831 Okay
23002832 Here
23002840 I have something to ask the Lord
23002841 Yes what
23002842 It ’s a way to shed your child ’s blood.
23002843 ... why do you want it?
23002844 Get the tears of a dragon in Senkyo
23002845 Fulfill immortality
23002846 For that, there is the blood of the child.
23002847 …Is that so
23002848 Certainly, the blood of the Son of the Dragon Seed does not flow in the usual way.
23002849 However, there is something to do that at Senmineji Temple.
23002850 What is it
23002851 A sword that kills even those who do not die with ordinary techniques ...
23002852 Immortal sword
23002853 Here
23002880 Is it the one with the length written on it?
23002881 Okay
23002882 If you&#39;re an immortal sword ...
23002883 It will also be possible to injure the dragon&#39;s son and shed blood.
23002884 …Do you get it
23002885 With this, immortality goes one step further ...
23002886 Let&#39;s tell your child
23002887 …Okay
23002900 As I told you ...
23002901 If it is an immortal sword, it will be possible to injure Kuro-sama and shed blood.
23002902 Oh
23002903 Let&#39;s tell your child
23002904 …Okay
23003100 &quot;I have to do what I should do ...&quot;
23003101 e?
23003102 The child said so
23003103 Probably something ... Hidden
23003104 …Is that so…
23003105 ………
23003106 …what up
23003107 There was a word &quot;Kaishakunin&quot; in the record of Mr. Takeshi.
23003108 Oh
23003109 Perhaps what is kaishakunin ...
23003110 With the life of the Son of the Dragon, cut off its immortality
23003111 …What did you say
23003112 like this…. If you can walk the path of immortality
23003113 With an immortal sword, Kuro-sama ...
23003114 You must cut off your child&#39;s life
23003115 …Okay
23003116 Immortality is what Kuro wants ... I know that.
23003117 but…. Wolf ...
23003118 Is there a way not to kill Kuro-sama ...
23003119 … The dragon seed is an extraordinary power
23003120 There may be such a way
23003121 … Then, Wolf Hall
23003122 The way not to kill Kuro-sama ...
23003123 Would you please explore it together?
23003200 ... with the Lord ...
23003201 Okay
23003202 ... I saw the illusion of the Lord and Kuro
23003203 Illusion ...?
23003204 Oh
23003205 ... where is Kuro-sama now?
23003206 Come in captivity near the castle of Ashina and its castle tower.
23003207 But the castle gate is closed
23003208 Really
23003300 ... with the Lord ...
23003301 Okay
23003302 ... I saw the illusion of the Lord and Kuro
23003303 Illusion ...?
23003304 Oh

23010000 Is there a way to enter
23010001 On the roof, there is a road for the people of the night hawks
23010002 The people of the night hawk use the signal smoke as a mark
23010003 Okay
23010004 If you follow the smoke signal of the night hawk ...
23010005 I&#39;ll put it away from you along the roof

23010021 Do you get it
23010100 Do you get it

23010151 However…

23100312 But I have to fulfill the life of the Lord
23100313 The gourd of medicinal water you have ...
23100314 It was originally created by me
23100315 Help as a pharmacist
23100400 Wolf, I often visited
23100500 Yup…?

23100551 What
23100552 … Please show me your face a little
23100553 Oh

23100604 What
23100605 The stagnation of the dragon
23100606 The sign may be coming out
23100607 What is stagnation?
23100608 I&#39;ve heard from my teacher, Dogen
23100609 The power of the dragon is stagnant as it dies ...
23100610 The stagnation will surely overflow if it accumulates
23100611 What happens if it overflows
23100612 Illness is spread
23100613 It would be nice if it was a misery ...
23100614 If something goes wrong ...
23100615 Oh, let&#39;s go to the Lord
23100700 … Did you meet the Buddhist priest?
23100701 Oh. That is…
23100702 Okay. I&#39;ve heard from my teacher, Dogen
23100703 Dragon seeds can bestow the power of regeneration
23100704 But it&#39;s an extraordinary force
23100705 If you repeat it, it will soon fall as a disease to those who are involved in the overflow of stagnation.
23100706 The disease is called dragon cough ...
23100707 Knowing that I couldn&#39;t stop it, I&#39;m not sure ...
23100708 I&#39;m sorry
23100709 … The way to cure that dragon cough
23100710 I do not understand. But I have to find out ...
23100711 First of all, I will try to hit the record left by the teacher
23100712 ask…

23100755 The disease is called dragon cough ...

23100757 I&#39;m sorry
23100758 … The way to cure that dragon cough
23100759 I do not understand. But I have to find out ...
23100760 First of all, I will try to hit the record left by the teacher
23100761 ask…
23100800 What are you doing
23100801 ………Hmm? Oh, are you
23100802 To investigate dragon cough
23100803 I received a blood clot that the Buddhist priest had spit out.
23100804 Blood clot?
23100805 Okay. It came out with a cough
23100806 The color of the blood seems to be slightly stagnant ...
23100807 But ... this alone is definitely ...
23100808 Is there anything I can do
23100809 … A blood clot that a person with a dragon cough vomits
23100810 The more it is, the more detailed it can be
23100811 If anyone has a dragon cough, let&#39;s hit it
23100812 …Please
23100900 To find out ...
23100901 In addition to the Buddhist priest, I want a blood clot that was vomited by a person with a dragon cough.

23101106 Eventually it will be resurrected
23101107 I&#39;m probably robbing somewhere of the alternative power ...
23101108 From those who have a dragon cough
23101109 Probably
23101110 Those who have a dragon cough ...
23101111 People are deprived of the natural power to live as humans

23101300 Overflow of stagnation from the eyes of the dragon ... It seems that it was suppressed

23110001 Okay. Originally for Kuro-sama
23110002 You were taking over
23110003 You may have noticed ...
23110004 This gourd&#39;s medicinal water naturally springs up.
23110005 When it&#39;s exhausted, if you rest a little, it will fill up again.

23110008 Seeds ...

23110207 Disagreeable
23110208 Then ... it means that it will appear in the one that received the dragon seed ...
23110209 Or ... only a trillion ...
23110210 HM…
23110211 ... is it okay?
23110212 Oh enough

23110302 Or ... only a trillion ...
23110303 HM…

23110506 I noticed that I was alive again
23110507 I died once ... I&#39;m alive again now
23110508 Then it would be regenerative
23110509 Regeneration?
23110510 Kuro-sama ...
23110511 It is said to be the power of the Son of the Dragon Seed.
23110512 Those who have been given the power of regeneration will die and still be resurrected.
23110513 Many times
23110514 ……… Stupid
23110515 Okay. It&#39;s strange
23110516 But it&#39;s actually happening ...
23110517 Please let me know if there are any changes
23110518 I don&#39;t think the power of regeneration seeks anything in return.
23110600 The power of regeneration is Kuro-sama&#39;s ...
23110601 It is said to be the power of the Son of the Dragon Seed.
23110602 Those who have been given the power of regeneration will die and still be resurrected.
23110603 Many times
23110604 Please let me know if there are any changes
23110605 I don&#39;t think the power of regeneration seeks anything in return.
23110700 I&#39;ve heard from my teacher, Dogen
23110701 The power of the dragon is that it stagnates as it dies.
23110702 And if you collect it, it will overflow from the eyes of the dragon ...
23110703 There are signs of stagnation in the back of your eyes
23110704 Yes, I&#39;m thinking
23110705 If anything goes wrong, please come to me
23110800 There must be a way to cure a dragon cough
23110801 First of all, I will try to hit the record left by the teacher
23110900 To find out ...
23110901 In addition to the Buddhist priest, I want a blood clot that was vomited by a person with a dragon cough.
23110902 Do you get it. Let&#39;s hit
23110903 …Please
23111000 I got
23111001 It&#39;s a blood clot. let me see
23111002 … The color of blood is slightly stagnant, similar to that of the Buddhist priest.
23111003 But this is ... Hmm ...
23111004 Is it enough
23111005 ... probably
23111006 With this, we will proceed with the investigation of dragon cough.
23111007 When you come back, you have a solution
23111008 Please expect
23111100 With the blood clot you received, we will proceed with the investigation of dragon cough.
23111101 When you come back, you have a solution
23111102 Please expect
23111200 Make a medicine for dragon cough
23111201 Do you get it
23111202 Let&#39;s get the power of regeneration
23111203 ...... Gu ...
23111204 Please receive this
23111205 It is a medicine for dragon cough that suppresses blood stagnation.
23111300 In the past, it is said that the dragon cough had spread to Ashina.
23111301 At that time, it couldn&#39;t be cured ... No one was saved.
23111302 …Really
23111303 It would be nice if my teacher, Dogen&#39;s regrets, were alleviated.
23111400 One has to die
23111401 Hmm!
23111402 What does that mean
23111403 Did you hear
23111404 teach me
23111405 ……… I saw
23111406 That day, under the everlasting cherry tree ...
23111407 Tomoe-den ... was about to be suicide ...
23111408 Why suicide etc.
23111409 Tomoe-den said:
23111410 &quot;Immortality receiving the blood of the dragon will bind the Lord.&quot;
23111411 … For human return
23111412 Whoever receives the blood of the dragon must die?
23111413 …Okay. That&#39;s right
23111414 However, there was no return
23111415 Okay. Probably because there was no immortal slash
23111416 ………
23111417 I&#39;m Kuro-sama ...
23111418 And you don&#39;t want to lose
23111419 Every road is a dead end ...
23111500 ………
23111600 What are you hiding ...?
23111601 ………that too
23111602 I heard it
23111603 teach me
23111604 ………
23111605 Do what you should do
23111606 I want to do that, just like my child
23111607 …this
23111650 Is this a bell ...
23111651 I&#39;m sure it spilled from the corpse of the owl.
23111652 Owl and you have a deep connection ...
23111653 If you offer it, you may see a different memory.
23111654 … Let&#39;s offer
23111655 I don&#39;t know what kind of memory it is
23111656 But that&#39;s what the owl had
23111657 Please be careful ...
23111700 Sake
23111701 It&#39;s a funny person ...
23111702 This is a cheerful celebration
23111703 Please deliver it to the Buddhist priest
23111800 Sake
23111801 Oh…
23111802 Thank you, let&#39;s have it
23111803 (Kokukokukoku) Hmm ... delicious
23111804 When I&#39;m a pharmacist, I sometimes use alcohol in addition to drinking like this.
23111805 Purification etc.
23111806 Yes, you can give it to someone who can&#39;t stand the pain.
23111807 However, when I was a kid, I was not good at smelling alcohol.
23111808 Have you helped a pharmacist since you were a kid?
23111809 Okay. Master&#39;s ... Dogen-sama, I wanted to be useful
23111810 I competed with my brothers to treat patients.
23111811 This is the time. Many suffered arrow injuries and sword injuries.
23111812 ………Really
23111813 ………
23111814 what up
23111815 No
23111816 Then, from time to time, some shinobi came.
23111817 Once ... a very troubled patient
23111818 How are you in trouble
23111819 It&#39;s hard to speak
23111820 Where it hurts, how much it hurts ...
23111821 I don&#39;t know that, so I closed it
23111822 Really
23111823 … It ’s like saying something like someone else ’s affair
23111824 What did you say?
23111825 No, I don&#39;t have anything
23111900 This is mainly
23111901 Oh…
23111902 Isshin-sama is your favorite sake
23111903 Let&#39;s eat
23111904 (Kokukokukoku) Hmm ... delicious
23111905 (Koku) ………
23111906 ………
23111907 (Koku) ……… Something
23111908 Hmm?
23111909 Tell me something
23111910 ... I want to hear one
23111911 Okay
23111912 Who is the sword master?
23111913 sword…? I&#39;m a pharmacist
23111914 Who?
23111915 ... Ichishin-sama
23111916 (Koku) But it&#39;s just a taste
23111917 Your sword spirit ... I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a taste
23111918 For what
23111919 People do not slash
23111920 … Does anyone cut it?
23111921 Okay. If you want to kill people,
23111922 However, if a demon appears, I would like to slash it.
23111923 ghost…?
23111924 Whew, don&#39;t take it seriously
23111925 It&#39;s just a joke ...
23112000 Sake
23112001 Oh, this is ...
23112002 Kusukusukusu ... Isn&#39;t it monkey booze?
23112003 What&#39;s wrong
23112004 First of all, I will
23112005 (Kokukkokukkoku ...) Hmm ... or spicy ...
23112006 Uh ... yes, monkeys ... I have something to do with monkeys.
23112007 With a monkey?
23112008 Okay. After all, I&#39;m a child picked up by a monkey
23112009 ………
23112010 (Koku ...) Believe me, I don&#39;t.
23112011 ……… Childhood
23112012 Alone on the battlefield
23112013 I stood stunned
23112014 ………
23112015 Nothing ... I couldn&#39;t cry or get angry, but I was stunned ...
23112016 Then the monkey was eating rice balls
23112017 Is it a monkey ...
23112018 Yes it looks good
23112019 I thought it was enviable
23112020 Then the monkey gave me a rice ball.
23112021 It was very good ...
23112022 Kind, monkey
23112023 Fufu ... It was a kind monkey
23112100 I brought liquor
23112101 Oh, it&#39;s Ryusen ...
23112102 Let&#39;s eat
23112103 (Kokukkokukkoku ...) Hmm ...
23112104 ………Jeez
23112105 what up
23112106 No, when Isshin gets this Ryusen ...
23112107 At the castle of Ashina ... People gather and make a noise, and a banquet begins.
23112108 At that time, I was taking a walk behind the castle, leaving Dogen-sama behind.
23112109 What are you doing behind the castle?
23112110 ………I agree
23112111 Source vortex
23112112 What is it
23112113 In the distance, the direction in which the source water flows out ...
23112114 It ’s a big whirlpool that you can see there.
23112115 The whirlpool is wearing lightning
23112116 Genichiro used to wield his sword.
23112117 While staring at the thunder vortex cloud ...
23112118 ………
23112200 Kuro-sama has always ...
23112201 You were tied up to be the Son of the Dragon Seed
23112202 Unleashed from there ...
23112203 I just want you to live as a person
23112204 I just hope it
23112300 Wolf Palace...
23112301 What
23112302 ……… Please, martial arts
23112303 Oh
23112400 Wolf Palace...
23112401 Just a little ...
23112402 I think the wrinkles between the eyebrows have become thinner
23112403 ………
23112404 Kuro-sama&#39;s immortality, please give it to me.
23120000 see you
23120100 see you…
23120200 If you drink it ...
23120201 The unstoppable cough of those with a dragon cough will stop
23120202 …Oh
23120300 Ah ... what, Chirin,
23120301 Oh, this bell
23120302 Handed over to offer to the Buddha
23120303 Hmm ... Is it a bell that has something to do with you?
23120304 Then why not talk to the Buddhist priest?
23120305 If it ’s about Buddha, that person will be familiar with it.
23120350 Ah ... what, Chirin,
23120351 Oh, this bell
23120352 Hmm ... Is it a bell that has something to do with you?
23120353 Then why not talk to the Buddhist priest?
23120354 If it ’s about Buddha, that person will be familiar with it.
23120400 see you
23120500 Wolf Hall ... See you again
24100000 Another mouse
24100001 ………
24100002 No, that eye ... a hungry wolf?
24100003 I&#39;ll ask you for your name before you slash
24100004 Give yourself your name!
24100005 ………
24100006 Isn&#39;t there a name that claims to be crazy?
24100007 Ninja is usually so. Die without giving your name
24100008 Jaga ...
24100009 I miss that left arm and shinobi
24100010 ...... Kuha ... Cool!
24100011 I see, I like the wolf on the arm!
24100012 Then ...
24100013 Wolf
24100014 Let&#39;s call the Lord so
24100015 What are you ...
24100016 Kakaka, I&#39;m a reed-named tengu
24100017 Oh, the ship wolf!
24100018 Do you not hunt mice too?
24100019 …What did you say
24100020 This reed name has a mouse in it.
24100021 There are various mice ...
24100022 From one end ... Throw it away!
24100023 Apparently, the Lord also has a talent for slashing, and it will be useful for polishing that talent.
24100024 How about a ship wolf! Would you like to hunt mice?
24100100 How are you, Ship Wolf?
24100101 Did you feel like hunting mice?
24100200 Let&#39;s go! It&#39;s like hunting a mouse
24100201 Oh
24100202 After all, the Lord has a talent for slashing people
24100203 Good. Reward, save
24100250 is this…
24100251 It&#39;s the Ashina style!
24100252 There is no formal rule even if it is called a school
24100253 Just win the battle. A sword that makes that one thing supreme
24100254 For mouse hunting ... Above all, it should be useful for your battle
24100300 Ashina
24100301 There is no formal rule even if it is called a school
24100302 Just win the battle. A sword that makes that one thing supreme
24100303 For mouse hunting ... Above all, it should be useful for your battle
24110000 I understand
24110001 Good!
24110002 Ship wolf, then I&#39;ll give you this
24110050 is this…
24110051 Kakaka, the face of a mouse, and the burrow
24110052 Slash it!
24110053 By the way, let&#39;s do something useful for your battle
24110100 turn down
24110101 Kakaka, do you refuse? Regrettable
24110102 If you feel like it, say
24000500 Oh, it ’s a ship wolf!
24000501 is this…
24000502 An? Kakaka, the mice in Uchifu
24000503 These guys come in from anywhere
24000504 There is no cut even if you cut it
24000505 … Sometimes a ship wolf
24000506 Did you master the reed name style?
24000507 Is ...
24000508 Yeah, sure
24000509 After all, the Lord has a talent for slashing people
24000510 The reed name style is mysterious and usable
24000550 Surely
24000551 Ship wolf, if you&#39;re the Lord ... (Goho)
24000552 (Gohogohogoho)
24000553 Tengu-den ...?
24000554 ………
24000555 I&#39;m going to cool down here a little more
24000556 Go, ship wolf
24000600 Oh, it ’s a ship wolf!
24000601 is this…
24000602 An? Kakaka, the mice in Uchifu
24000603 These guys come in from anywhere
24000604 There is no cut even if you cut it
24000605 … Sometimes a ship wolf
24000606 Did you master the reed name style?
24000607 ………
24000608 Hmm ...
24000609 Still not enough
24000610 Ship wolf, cut even more!
24000700 ………
24000701 Go, ship wolf
24000000 At the life of your child
24000001 Oh
24000002 What i want to ask
24000003 before that
24000004 Sake!
24000005 Is ...?
24000006 Save it as a reward
24000050 … My grandson, Genichiro, who was fascinated by the strange water
24000051 Well, he stopped that
24000052 I&#39;ll thank you
24000053 Until I obeyed the rules of my father-in-law
24000054 The law of ninja
24000055 I see ... Lord, the owl&#39;s father?
24000056 A child picked up in that country stealing battle
24000057 ... is
24000058 Go around and get here ...
24000059 Kakaka, the relationship between people is really interesting!
24000060 Don&#39;t you think so ... Yeah, a ship wolf
24000061 …You…
24000062 ... and what the Lord wants to know
24000100 Ship wolf
24000101 What do you want to know because of immortality
24000200 Is it an immortal sword or a ship wolf?
24000201 What does it mean to not come out?
24000202 The son of Oku-no-in says ...
24000203 Immortal sword is a sword that brings death to those who pull it out
24000204 Is it something that can only be handled by someone like the Lord?
24000205 When I pulled out the immortal sword and saw the red blade ...
24000206 I also died once
24000207 ……… Yes, there is no red blade
24000208 No, the ship wolf
24000209 If you have an immortal slash, you can kill things that wouldn&#39;t normally die.
24000210 Makoto, it&#39;s a terrifying sword. Don&#39;t you think so?
24000211 ... what do you want to say
24000212 The sword is in the hands of the Lord
24000213 What to cut
24000214 Make a good decision and then pull it out.
24000215 ………
24000300 Immortal slash ...
24000301 A sword that slashes those who do not die is in the hands of the Lord
24000302 What to cut
24000303 Make a good decision and then pull it out.
24000800 Lord ... (Gohogoho)
24000801 ………
24000802 Kakaka, is that your worried face?
24000803 Emma is noisy, saying, &quot;Grandfather is here.&quot;
24000804 Sometimes, the ship wolf
24000805 The battle between the Lord and Kuro&#39;s immortality ... It&#39;s like a brim
24000806 Those who prevent the battle of immortality ... Did you slash?
24000807 ... slashed
24000808 Really…
24000809 I slashed without hesitation
24000820 Lord ... (Gohogoho)
24000821 ………
24000822 Kakaka, is that your worried face?
24000823 Emma is noisy, saying, &quot;Grandfather is here.&quot;
24000840 Sometimes, the ship wolf
24000841 The battle between the Lord and Kuro&#39;s immortality ... It&#39;s like a brim
24000842 Those who prevent the battle of immortality ... Did you slash?
24000843 ... slashed
24000844 Really…
24000845 I slashed without hesitation
24000900 Ship wolf, I won&#39;t forget
24000901 If you get lost, you lose ...
24000902 That&#39;s the battle
24001100 Let&#39;s go! It&#39;s like hunting a mouse
24001101 Oh
24001102 After all, the Lord has a talent for slashing people
24001103 Good. Reward, save
24001110 is this…
24001111 It&#39;s the Ashina style!
24001112 There is no formal rule even if it is called a school
24001113 Just win the battle. A sword that makes that one thing supreme
24001114 For mouse hunting ... Above all, it should be useful for your battle
24001200 … Sometimes a ship wolf
24001201 Did you master it?
24001202 Is ...
24001203 Yeah, sure
24001204 After all, the Lord has a talent for slashing people
24001205 Reward, save it
24001210 Surely
24000400 Is it a red immortal sword ...
24000401 Then, what&#39;s in his hand ... is it black?
24000402 … For power, throw away even yourself
24000403 ... sad ...
24001000 Isshin-sama ...
24001001 Emma is wondering if the tengu will appear again.
24001002 ... Emma
24001003 Okay
24001004 Genichiro will appear soon
24001005 Another swing of immortality ... to use it
24001006 To protect the reed name ...
24001007 I&#39;m going to throw all of myself
24001008 Oh…. Despite my grandchildren, I&#39;m prepared to be wonderful
24001009 ... But I can&#39;t let Kuro&#39;s blood be used
24001010 I&#39;ll shake the blade a few more times ...
24001011 Until then, the tengu is over
24001012 ... there is that person
24001013 Kakka, a ship wolf?
24001014 It ’s the top of the Buddha, but I ca n’t hate it somewhere ...
24001015 That guy is really interesting
24010000 Immortality, the goal of your child
24010001 The key to that
24010002 … Immortal slash
24010003 If it&#39;s an immortal slash ... or maybe it&#39;s the key
24010004 Immortal slash ...
24010005 A sword that kills those who do not die in ordinary techniques
24010006 What is the one who does not die
24010007 Mushi possession ... or something like that
24010008 I&#39;ve never seen it, but ...
24010009 Whether you pierce your heart or drop your neck, you&#39;ll die.
24010010 Kuku ... If true, it&#39;s terrifying ...
24010011 ………
24010012 Kill even those monsters ... that&#39;s an immortal sword
24010100 If you&#39;re an immortal sword ...
24010101 It may be the key to Kuro&#39;s goal of immortality
24010102 A sword that kills even those who die with ordinary techniques, because
24010200 Where is the immortal sword?
24010201 I hear that it is in Senmine Temple
24010202 However…
24010203 Immortal slashing is said to be inextricable
24010204 What does it mean to not come out?
24010205 However, it is transmitted that way.
24010206 ………
24010207 But now that temple has its gate closed
24010208 I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing, with a fishy smell, in the mountains ...
24010209 There is no connection on a decent road
24010210 How to get there
24010211 Abandoned prison on the outskirts of Ashina&#39;s castle ...
24010212 If you go through the waterway in the back, you will end up
24010300 I hear that the immortal sword is in Senmineji
24010301 However…
24010302 It&#39;s said that immortal slashing doesn&#39;t come off
24010303 There is no longer a decent road leading to Senmineji Temple
24010304 Abandoned prison on the outskirts of Ashina&#39;s castle ...
24010305 If you go through the waterway in the back, you will end up
24010400 Sake
24010401 Oh, don&#39;t be smart!
24010402 which one…
24010403 (Guiguigui) Puha ... Good liquor!
24010404 When I was in the winning battle, I drank it like this
24010405 All of the reeds
24010406 Ashi-mei Shuu in the Kunitori-sen ...
24010407 Kakaka, a national thief ...
24010408 Until I stole what was stolen
24010409 that is…
24010410 Originally, this reed name is ...
24010411 It was the place where our reeds lived
24010412 Water flowing out of the source
24010413 It ’s a people who love it
24010414 (Gui) Puha ... Therefore, sake is also delicious!
24010415 … But we were heretics and weak people
24010416 Naturally overrun and forced to submit
24010417 It&#39;s been a long time ...
24010418 It is not even allowed to enshrine the source water
24010419 Kakaka, up to that point ...
24010420 Even if you drink good sake, you will not really get drunk
24010421 … But the world was disturbed
24010422 Oh…
24010423 The turmoil of Japan ... This person is dying, the flames of war ...
24010424 Once an opportunity, he stole the country
24010425 But ... now it&#39;s dead ...
24010426 (Quit) Huh, it&#39;s ironic
24010500 this
24010501 Oh, let&#39;s get it!
24010502 (Guiguigui) Puha ... After all, this is it!
24010503 Sometimes the Lord ...
24010504 How was Genichiro?
24010505 What is ...
24010506 I think I crossed the blade
24010507 ... but it was strong
24010508 And ... a strange technique
24010509 How
24010510 What is Tomoe&#39;s thunder?
24010511 Kakaka, that&#39;s right
24010512 It ’s the skill of Genichiro ’s teacher.
24010513 It would have been quite interesting
24010514 What is a teacher ...
24010515 Tomoe ... That&#39;s not the case with such a messenger.
24010516 That woman fights like a dance
24010517 Looking into his eyes ...
24010518 It feels like you&#39;re drawn to the bottom of the water
24010519 Kakaka, I fell in love with it, and I was about to be cut ...
24010520 I lived this one heart for a long time, but only once
24010600 this
24010601 Lord ... Do you say that you should drink the sake that you have done?
24010602 I like it! Let&#39;s get it!
24010603 (Guiguigui) Puha ... After all, this is it!
24010604 Sometimes the Lord ...
24010605 How was Genichiro?
24010606 What is ...
24010607 I think I crossed the blade
24010608 ... but it was strong
24010609 And ... a strange technique
24010610 How
24010611 What is Tomoe&#39;s thunder?
24010612 Kakaka, that&#39;s right
24010613 It ’s the skill of Genichiro ’s teacher.
24010614 It would have been quite interesting
24010615 What is a teacher ...
24010616 Tomoe ... That&#39;s not the case with such a messenger.
24010617 That woman fights like a dance
24010618 Looking into his eyes ...
24010619 It feels like you&#39;re drawn to the bottom of the water
24010620 Kakaka, I fell in love with it, and I was about to be cut ...
24010621 I lived this one heart for a long time, but only once
24010700 Sake
24010701 Oh, the ship wolf! Attentive
24010702 Oh, isn&#39;t it monkey booze?
24010703 (Gwig Gwig) Car! This is what it means to blow fire!
24010704 Do you know another name for this sake, Lord?
24010705 I don&#39;t know
24010706 Don&#39;t you know
24010707 This guy is also called Shura Sake
24010708 (Gui) Once upon a time, I was ...
24010709 Shura ... No, I&#39;ve slashed something like Shura
24010710 It&#39;s ...
24010711 Those who continue to slash will eventually become Shura.
24010712 What were you slashing for ...
24010713 Forget about it, and you&#39;ll be captivated by the joy of slashing.
24010714 There is a shadow of Shura in your eyes
24010715 ………
24010716 At best, don&#39;t be cut off
24010717 Keep in mind
24010718 ... is
24010800 Sake
24010801 Oh, the ship wolf! Attentive
24010802 Oh, isn&#39;t it monkey booze?
24010803 (Gwig Gwig) Car! This is what it means to blow fire!
24010804 Do you know another name for this sake, Lord?
24010805 I don&#39;t know
24010806 Don&#39;t you know
24010807 This guy is also called Shura Sake
24010808 (Gui) Once upon a time, I was ...

24010812 What were you slashing for ...
24010813 Forget about it, and you&#39;ll be captivated by the joy of slashing.
24010814 I thought that there was a shadow of Shura in the eyes of the Lord.
24010815 ………
24010816 But it seems like it&#39;s gone
24010817 If Shura came out, I was about to cut it.
24010818 Kakakakaka!
24011300 this
24011301 How! Is it Ryusen?
24011302 It&#39;s big, a ship wolf!
24011303 (Gwig Gwig) Buhhhhh! I&#39;m dying!
24011304 Kakaka, when I get this Ryusen ...
24011305 It&#39;s the one that the idiots gathered to drink
24011306 Fools ...
24011307 To a fool who never let go of the Jumonji spear while drinking ...
24011308 An idiot who grabs people&#39;s sake with illusion ...
24011309 An idiot who is playing with a half-finished artificial limb in one hand
24011310 then…
24011311 It&#39;s a huge figure, and it turns bright red immediately, even if it&#39;s an owl!
24011312 that is…
24011313 Kakaka, your adoptive father was also a fool
24011400 this

24011412 that is…
24011413 Your adoptive father was also a fool ...
24011414 To the idiots ... (Gui)
24011415 Hmm ...
24020000 Go or ship wolf
24020001 Immortality ... It&#39;s also a battle
24020002 And in the war ...
24020003 Wishes and plots of those involved swirl
24020004 If you get lost, you will be drunk by the whirlpool ...
24020005 Lose to the battle
24020006 Kakaka, that&#39;s right. Keep in mind, it&#39;s good to keep
24020007 It&#39;s a ship wolf. If you get lost, you will lose
24020100 Go or ship wolf
24020101 Then
24060000 Shura again ...

26910350 I&#39;ll get blood
26910351 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Gohogoho)
26910352 … To Emma
27000000 Basket, basket, basket, basket, basket ...
27000001 We&#39;re in a basket ...
27000100 You ... Do you have anything to ask?
27000101 However, I&#39;m sorry ... Oh, let me stay in the basket as it is.
27010000 Hey
27010001 Good ...!
27010002 Basket, basket, basket, basket ... Ah ...
27010003 Calm down
27010004 ……… Ah, you… are you a decent person?
27010005 Oh
27010006 It was good ...!
27010007 You are a decent person
27010008 Higu ... Higu ...
27010009 You ... Do you have anything to ask?
27010010 However, I&#39;m sorry ... Oh, let me stay in the basket as it is.
27010100 ………
27010101 Basket, basket, basket ... Hmm?
27010102 Someone ... there ... there!
27010103 Great!
27010104 Calm down
27010105 ……… Ah, you… are you a decent person?
27010106 Oh
27010107 It was good ...!
27010108 You are a decent person
27010109 Higu ... Higu ...
27010110 You ... Do you have anything to ask?
27010111 However, I&#39;m sorry ... Oh, let me stay in the basket as it is.
27010200 What&#39;s going on in this village
27010201 I don&#39;t really understand
27010202 When I noticed, everyone ... it was going crazy
27010203 I was sick of my head, but ...
27010204 I woke up when I vomit
27010205 Did you vomit?
27010206 I&#39;m thirsty, Taku-san, I drank alcohol
27010207 I&#39;m sure it made me vomit
27010208 The priest sometimes serves sake
27010209 Just ... I&#39;m thirsty when I drink alcohol
27010210 The sake barrel will soon be empty
27010211 There is no choice but to sip the water of ponds and rivers
27010212 But the more I drink, the more thirsty I am ...
27010213 (Gollum ...) Oh ... I&#39;m thirsty, thirsty, irresistible ...
27010300 I want to know about the villagers
27010301 ... that&#39;s right
27010302 Everyone is afraid of fire
27010303 When my head was drowsy ... I was.
27010304 That fire that doesn&#39;t go out ... Even if I remember now, it&#39;s horrifying
27010305 If it ’s a fire that does n’t go out
27010306 The hunter Jiro burned &quot;pine fat&quot; and stayed at home.
27010307 His pine fat burns for a long time ... it&#39;s totally abominable
27010308 Jiro eats the meat of the beast, who is the sniffer of the village.
27010309 That&#39;s why the priest doesn&#39;t give him alcohol either.
27010310 Where is that Jiro&#39;s house
27010311 Jiro&#39;s house is on the other side of the pond.
27010400 Who is the priest
27010401 The priest is the greatest person in this village
27010402 You&#39;re at a company near the source of the water that goes back along the river.
27010403 The priest said
27010404 &quot;Let&#39;s all become Miyakobito&quot;
27010405 If you drink a lot of alcohol, you can become Miyakobito.
27010406 ………
27010407 What is Miyakobito?
27020000 That&#39;s right, is it going to be ...
27020001 We&#39;re in a basket here
27020002 (... Gokuri) I have to be patient
27030000 Hii!
27030100 Gya!
27030200 Stop it!
27030300 What are you doing!
27030400 Ginger ... Hey ...
27030500 From the basket ... I have to get out ...
27030550 Hidee ... Nah ... Ah ...
27130000 After all ... Oh ...
27130050 I drank it ...!
27900000 Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...
27900001 Is it sick ...
27900002 Zehi ... Zehi ...
27900003 Zehi ... why ... with such eyes ...
27900004 I&#39;m sure ... it&#39;s because I got out of the basket ...
27900100 Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...
27900101 Dragon cough ...
27900102 Zehi ... Zehi ...
27900103 Zehi ... why ... with such eyes ...
27900104 I&#39;m sure ... it&#39;s because I got out of the basket ...
27900150 Zehi ... Zehi ...
27900151 Zehi ... why ... with such eyes ...
27900152 I&#39;m sure ... it&#39;s because I got out of the basket ...
27900200 (Zehi, Zehi, Zehi ...)
27900300 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...)
27900400 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Gohogoho)
27900500 Hmm ... I don&#39;t know what it is ...
27900501 It seems that my breathlessness has healed
27900502 But when I was relieved, my throat was ...
27900503 (... Gokuri) I have to be patient
27900600 I&#39;ll get blood
27900601 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Gohogoho)
27900610 … To Emma
27910000 Drink ...
27910001 U ... Gollum ...
27910002 Ah ...
27910003 This will cure
27910004 At best ... at best ... at best ...
27910005 (... Gokuri) Okay ...
27910050 At best ... at best ... at best ...

30100100 (Gusut) By the way ...
30100101 I heard from my father about the misty hidden village.
30100102 Because it&#39;s an abominable village ...
30100103 Never enter ...
30100104 ……… But it doesn&#39;t matter now
30100105 By the way, the future is a thick foggy forest.
30100106 How did you get to that female player?
30100200 I can&#39;t stand
30100201 I will visit the abandoned prison as Shinobu taught me
30100300 Uh ... Shinobu, what ...
30100301 I was distracted by that investigation and asked for my unconsciousness ...
30100302 Ah ... I can hear it
30100303 I&#39;m sure that female player will be in the future ...
30100304 After all ... I guess I was waiting for you
30100400 Oh…
30100401 After all ... I guess I was waiting for you
30100500 What&#39;s there ... Shinobu ...?
30100501 Oh…
30100502 I have to thank Shinobu ...
30100503 Thank you ...
30100504 Would have brought that female player
30100505 Just a while ago ... while stroking me ... let me hear the investigation
30100506 ………
30100507 It&#39;s like a lullaby that&#39;s different than before ... It&#39;s peaceful and warm ...
30100508 While playing, he said this
30100509 &quot;Good, you came.&quot;
30100510 After all, I guess he was calling me
30100511 Shinobu ... Get this ...
30100520 I&#39;m ... I&#39;m already sleepy ...
30110000 Lord ...
30110001 …Hmm? Oh, Shinobu ...
30110002 Listen to me, but I finally saw it
30110003 I&#39;m a female player
30110004 You can see it from a distance ... Beautiful, but ephemeral ...
30110005 Ah ... I was asking if you were calling me
30110006 While I was fascinated by it, I quickly left behind the fog.
30110100 ………
30110101 Ah ... 儂 ... Is it 儂?
30110200 Why don&#39;t you go back to the abandoned prison
30110201 I see ... abandoned prison ...
30110202 Where you can hear the investigation ... Maybe it&#39;s connected ...
30110203 If you want to go to that female player, why don&#39;t you visit the abandoned prison once?
30110300 ………
30110301 Oh…
30110302 In the depths of the fog ... That investigation is calling
30130000 Well ...
30130001 Don&#39;t be jealous of not hearing the investigation
30130100 A person who does not understand the mercy of things ...
30130200 Oh…
30130201 I can hear you ... I&#39;m calling ...
30200000 Ah ... ah ...
30200001 Faintly ... but I can tell ...
30200002 It&#39;s like ... calling someone and crying ...
30200003 Maybe this is ...?
30200100 I have to follow ...
30200101 That investigation ... I&#39;m sure ...
30200102 How can I chase ... Shinobu, do you have any idea?
30200200 If you go to the abandoned prison, you can follow this investigation ...
30200201 Know who you are begging for ...
30200202 Ah ... ah ...
30200300 Guu ... Guooo ...
30200400 Ah ... Ugoo ...
30210000 Lord ...
30210001 Occasionally ... oh ... you can hear it
30210002 Hey, tell me ... are you calling me ...?
30210003 what up
30210004 Hmm? Oh, which one is Shinobi
30210005 I followed the sound and went to the edge of this hole
30210006 You see, faintly ... riding the wind ...
30210007 You can hear that investigation from the bottom of the hole ...?
30210008 I can&#39;t hear anything
30210009 ……… Yes, can you hear it only for a moment?
30210010 Ah ... the duty is already good ... I have to follow that investigation
30210011 I feel that the investigation is calling for a moment.
30210100 ………
30210101 Occasionally ... oh ... you can hear it
30210200 I don&#39;t know
30210201 … Is it left?
30210202 Then leave it alone
30210203 I want to listen alone here
30210300 Why don&#39;t you go to the abandoned prison?
30210301 I see, over there ...
30210302 The investigation can be heard from the bottom of the hole
30210303 You might be able to go down from somewhere in the abandoned prison ...
30210304 Oh
30210305 It&#39;s abandoned prison ... I understand ...

33160301 Do you still stand ...
33160302 What supports you so much ...
33160400 Why can&#39;t you break ...

40000001 Did the demon Katabe finally become a corpse?
40000002 …
40000003 But nothing will change
40000004 The war continues, the corpse is clogged, and only grudges fill

40000407 ... I&#39;m sure he&#39;s grateful too ...
40000500 ... you remember
40000501 The grudge has already lost the place to accumulate
40000502 If the war continues, the world will be worse
40000503 ... that&#39;s why you can&#39;t take the place
40000600 Come on, go
40000601 You have a role to play ...
40000602 Is there anything I should do?

43900502 ... I can&#39;t die, I&#39;m hurt, and I&#39;m just getting grudges

44000104 Goho, Geho ...
44000105 … Now, it ’s a memorial service.
44000200 … What is the memorial service?
44010000 ... Oh, you&#39;re in the cave ahead
44010001 It ’s just an old shrine, it ’s the home of the snake god.
44010002 Besides, if the snake god drinks it, we can&#39;t make a memorial service.
44010003 Goho, Gehogeho ...
44020000 Where there are dead people, there are memorial services
44020001 No matter where you go, don&#39;t miss the memorial service ...

46900501 Thank you. Now you can continue the memorial service
46900502 … It doesn&#39;t matter if you die. It ’s a memorial service, and it ’s a drink.
46900503 ... hee, hee hee ...
46900504 … Well, what is your memorial service?
47000000 ... Husband, it looks like there&#39;s no samurai in this castle
47000001 ... Stealth, I thought it was a lot of work
47000100 Oh, of course, thank you
47000101 My eating habits are information
47000102 If you could silence the samurai around here ...
47000103 Let&#39;s teach my husband good stories
47000200 Oh, of course, thank you. Because it&#39;s a transaction
47000201 My eating habits are information
47000202 If you could silence the samurai around here ...
47000203 Let&#39;s teach my husband good stories
47000300 … Husband, it ’s a lot of work. I was saved
47000301 Thank you for your promise
47000310 ... Well, if you have a husband, I&#39;ll see you again
47000400 ... Yeah, are you still doing something?
47000401 I hate it and I don&#39;t trade in dangerous places
47000402 Somehow there is a life
47000403 If there is a connection, I&#39;ll see you somewhere again
47000500 ... Husband, no matter what you say, you don&#39;t trade in dangerous places
47000501 If there is a connection, I&#39;ll see you somewhere again
47000600 ... Husband, it looks like there&#39;s no samurai in this castle
47000601 … Stealth, that&#39;s a lot of work
47010000 Oh
47010001 After all
47010002 Then ... Can you silence the samurai around here?
47010003 I&#39;m not good at it ... I&#39;m being chased persistently
47010004 At all, it wouldn&#39;t be the case that I was chasing after the serious samurai of Ashina ...
47010100 …
47010101 Hehe, well, that&#39;s right
47010102 … Then why not trade one?
47010103 I want the samurai around here to be silent
47010104 I&#39;m not good at it ... I&#39;m being chased persistently
47010105 At all, it wouldn&#39;t be the case that I was chasing after the serious samurai of Ashina ...
47010200 Oh
47010201 After all
47010202 Anyway, it was saved
47010203 I&#39;m not good at it ... I was chased by the samurai and came.
47010204 My husband shut me up
47010205 ... this is that gratitude
47010210 Because my eating habits are information
47010300 …
47010301 Hehe, well, that&#39;s right
47010302 Anyway, it was saved
47010303 I&#39;m not good at it ... I was chased by the samurai and came.
47010304 My husband shut me up
47010305 ... this is that gratitude
47010310 Because my eating habits are information
47030000 Come on!
47030100 Husband! please stop!
47030200 Stop it!
47030300 Isn&#39;t it!
47030400 ... what I did ...
47030401 ... I made a mistake, look at it ...
47100000 Oh, isn&#39;t it the husband at that time! I was taken care of at the castle of Ashina
47100001 I need to sort out the material I bought here for a while.
47100002 If you&#39;re a husband, you&#39;ll also do business. How is it?
47100100 … Husband, are you stealth?
47100200 Yo, my husband
47100201 Do you need a business again?
47100300 … Finally, it started
47100301 Isshin Ashina has passed away, and it&#39;s a big invasion of the inner prefecture.
47100302 ... I won&#39;t have a reed name anymore
47100303 Well, it&#39;s finally time for me to ...
47100304 Husband, do you still need business?
47100400 Husband, do you still need business?
47110000 Oh
47110001 After all
47110002 Then why not buy my information?
47110003 If you&#39;re a ninja, you know? The value of information
47110100 …
47110101 Hehe, well, that&#39;s right
47110102 Anyway, just right
47110103 Husband, why don&#39;t you buy my information?
47110200 ... Oh, it&#39;s something other than information
47110201 It&#39;s an old habit. I&#39;m gonna collect it
47110202 I didn&#39;t like the memorial service, so I missed a bit ... but when I saw the corpse, I had to leave it alone.
47110203 ... and, well, the goods aren&#39;t worth it, right?
47110204 Hahahaha
47110300 ... Oh, be careful if you go to the castle of your husband Ashina
47110301 Weird guys finally get in and hate a lot
47110302 Uchifu, I&#39;m scared of Ashina Isshin, but ... I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve been able to get rid of my numbness.
47110303 ... It&#39;s about time for Ashina to be at the tide ...
47110400 ... that samurai who doesn&#39;t die, I think he&#39;s finally dead
47110401 I don&#39;t really understand what a serious samurai thinks
47110402 If you don&#39;t die, you should live happily ...
47110403 ... Anyway, my husband had a hard time
47110404 He&#39;s definitely a Buddhahood
47110405 Hahahaha
47110500 Oh, if you&#39;re a Buddhist old man, it&#39;s gone
47110501 While fluttering and saying the flames ...
47110502 Maybe I went to the battlefield
47110503 ... it doesn&#39;t matter to me ...
47110600 Well then, my husband
47900000 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...)
47900001 Lord ... what&#39;s wrong?
47900002 But my husband ... I can&#39;t breathe ... I can&#39;t ...
47900003 Chi, damn it ... I&#39;m gonna die like this and collect ...
47900004 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...)
47900010 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...)
47900011 Lord ...
47900012 But my husband ... I can&#39;t breathe ... I can&#39;t ...
47900013 Chi, damn it ... I&#39;m gonna die like this and collect ...
47900014 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...)
47900050 But my husband ... I can&#39;t breathe ... I can&#39;t ...
47900051 Chi, damn it ... I&#39;m gonna die like this and collect ...
47900052 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...)
47900100 Drink this ...
47900101 U ... Gollum ...
47900102 Oh, thank you ...
47900150 Oh, thank you ...
47900200 ………
47900201 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...)
47900300 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Zehi ...)
47900400 I&#39;ll get blood
47900401 (Zehi ... Zehi ... Gohogoho)
47900410 … To Emma
47900500 Oh my husband, I was waiting
47900501 Thanks to your medicine, I was saved. Thank you
47900502 This is a thank you. I hope it helps my husband
47900510 ... Of course, there are other stories
47900550 Oh my husband, I was waiting
47900551 Thanks to your medicine, I was saved. Thank you
48000000 … Did you get lost in this phantom hall?
48000001 And have a mission ... I want to leave here ...
48000002 Oh
48000003 Then, grab the monkeys drawn on the folding screen.
48000004 By the way, let&#39;s hear your child&#39;s voice.
48000100 Do you have anything you would like to ask?
48000101 If you know me, let me know
48000200 … Why did you come back?
48000201 There is no mission here, so please be quiet ... Please go home.
48000300 … Why did you come back?
48000301 I and that big boy ... I just want to be here quietly ... Please go home.
48010000 The monkey in purple kimono is the &quot;monkey to see&quot;
48010001 You can see well, you can see far away, and you notice well ...
48010002 Ordinarily, you will be seen and escaped before you approach.
48010003 Because he is a terribly timid monkey
48010100 A monkey in a green kimono is a &quot;listening monkey&quot;
48010101 You can hear well, hear well in the distance, and notice well ...
48010102 Ordinarily, you will notice the sound and escape before you approach it.
48010103 Because he is a terribly timid monkey
48010200 The monkey in orange kimono is a &quot;monkey to say&quot;
48010201 My eyes and ears aren&#39;t particularly good,
48010202 If you see people, you make a fuss and all the monkeys run away.
48010203 Or are you kidding people?
48010300 Oh, I don&#39;t want to leave the phantom corridor
48010301 It&#39;s usually quiet here, and in a way, it&#39;s close to Buddha&#39;s enlightenment ... it feels like that.
48010302 ... Oh, that reminds me ...
48010303 There used to be someone with a mission, like you
48010304 I think I was chasing the monkeys for a while, but ... someday it became quiet.
48010305 ... I hope you can grab the monkeys.
48020000 There used to be someone with a mission, like you
48020001 I think I was chasing the monkeys for a while, but ... someday it became quiet.
48020002 ... I hope you can grab the monkeys.

49000001 ... I wanted to see the ninja that was torn because of incompetence and exposed my life shame, but ... Isn&#39;t it by all means?
49000002 If you really die, there are plenty of opportunities ...
49000100 Hmm, you ... Is that the wolf he was talking about?
49000101 It doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s out of the question ...
49000102 Well good. Let me try if you really die
49000190 Hey, you ... the wolf he was talking about?
49000191 It doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s out of the question ...

50030000 For my son ...
50030001 Leave that sword
50030002 ... I can&#39;t
50030003 Stupid pretty
50030050 For my son ...
50030051 Leave that sword
50030100 The blade, etc., does not lead to this armor
50030101 Why not solve it ...
50030200 Nuu! ??
50030201 ... No, the armor doesn&#39;t move. Can&#39;t fall
50030300 Gunuu! After all, do you want to drop it!
50030301 Don&#39;t kick my armor!
50030400 Far from a thousand ...
50030401 That child has the grace of strangeness ...
50030500 Donkey art!
50030510 Wow!
60000200 The moon-viewing turret is illuminated by the moon tonight ...
60000201 Your child will also read the book in the moonlight
60000202 That&#39;s right
60000203 It ’s a pity to be a prisoner, even though I ’m just a kid.
60000204 Ah ... I wonder if Genichiro has some thoughts ...
60001500 Is the door of the Tsukimi turret closed properly?
60001501 It&#39;s closed, but ...
60001502 I&#39;ll leave the holes in the wall as they are
60001503 Oh, you don&#39;t have to worry about that
60001504 There is nothing that can be passed through the hole near the cliff.
60001600 Under this bridge ... There will be a loophole in the moat.
60001601 I told you to keep an eye on that too
60001602 Hmm ... What a strict precaution
60001603 Maybe the battle is near ...
60001700 … Is it really possible to win this battle?
60001701 I have a bad feeling ...
60001702 What is bearish
60001703 Even though he is sick, Isshin-sama&#39;s bow is also wonderful.
60001704 In addition, there may be a demon-shaped club.
60001705 Oh, Mr. Masataka Oniba!
60001706 Certainly, if you and Oni Kage are together
60001707 I can&#39;t think of the Otemon being pulled out.
60001800 Akaoni, I&#39;m worried just to tie it up
60001801 It can&#39;t be helped if we were attacked before the war
60001802 … In case of emergency, I have no choice but to use fire
60001803 Red eyes are afraid of fire
60001804 I can&#39;t reach it ... It&#39;s changed, the battle of Ashina ...
60001900 Look ... There is a smoke signal at Otemon
60001901 Mr. Katabe ...
60001902 Oh, it ’s just a demon
60001903 If there is that person, the reed name is still safe.
60002000 Uh ... I&#39;m a little bay ... I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m a horse ...
60002001 They threaten firecrackers ...
60002002 Uh ... I&#39;m dead ... I&#39;m dead ...
60002100 … Big brother, next is this hall?
60002101 No, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll go next
60002102 ... Kendo, if it&#39;s an offering, to Mr. Shigezo ...
60002103 Stop it!
60002104 No need to touch the Buddha ... How many times do you know, octopus!
60002105 Don&#39;t get angry, big brother
60002106 I&#39;m sorry for the octopus ...
60002200 Ugh! Open here!
60002201 I know I&#39;m hiding!
60002202 If you don&#39;t surrender quietly, you&#39;ll get hurt!
60002203 Can you hear me! Ugh!
60002300 … The mansion is a sea of fire by now
60002301 Ah ... If you come out, you can&#39;t mistake it for this hidden cave
60002302 Shigezo-sama told me that one mouse shouldn&#39;t escape.
60002303 I know
60002304 I hate it originally, so if it&#39;s dangerous, I&#39;ll just run away, there&#39;s a coward ...
60002400 … It ’s a serious illness, it ’s still serious.
60002401 Hmm ... Even though Genichiro is in the land of reeds, it doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s going to be long.
60002402 And what&#39;s the other task?
60002403 … The side of the castle&#39;s serpentine seems to be noisy with Kurokasa
60002404 Then next is over there
60002405 But meticulously ... Mujina Kurokasa can&#39;t be killed half-life ...
60002500 ... I wonder if I really intend to use that for battle
60002501 Oh, but I can&#39;t help it
60002502 Reashina is now in danger of surviving.
60002503 Jaga ...
60002504 Yeah, screaming, screaming, you&#39;ll get caught up in that sort of thing.
60002505 Once you get angry
60002600 Lord, it seems that the big child was dressed in armor
60002601 Oh, that guy, it was a really difficult job
60002602 But wasn&#39;t it worth it?
60002603 In addition to that huge body, it&#39;s not possible to pass the blade now.
60002604 Well, that&#39;s right ... I&#39;m trying to force myself to wear it.
60002605 If anything, the armor will come off immediately
60002700 Muu ... Do you say you don&#39;t have enough salt?
60002701 Hmm ... of course I eat ...
60002702 It is also necessary for cleaning wounds and Buddha ...
60002703 It doesn&#39;t mean that this many deaths will continue ...
60002704 Hmm ... Thanks to that, many people get battlefield illness.
60002705 Yeah ... I have to get some salt ...
60002800 Hmm ... I don&#39;t come ...
60002801 The time limit for change is over
60002802 Doesn&#39;t anyone come ...
60002900 Just...
60002901 It is said that someone like you will be defeated ...
60002902 There seems to be a demon lurking in the reeds ...
60003000 Hmm ...
60003001 … This country is about to reach the tide
60003002 More than that, the enemy is the Uchifu ...
60003003 If my grandfather collapses ... I think it&#39;s a losing battle at once
60003004 … But will the money come out properly?
60003005 Even if I run away, my wallet should be light ...
60003006 Hmm ...
60003100 (Namu Amida Butsu ... Namu Amida Butsu ... Namu Amida Butsu ...)
60003101 Huh ...
60003102 ... I&#39;m sorry everyone
60003103 However, even though I don&#39;t have any money, I can&#39;t live my life ...
60003104 Well ... how did you escape ...
60003105 Hmm ...
60003200 Cook Cook ...
60003201 I didn&#39;t even know the countryside ninja trap of Ashina, and I was able to catch it properly.
60003202 What a stupid thing ...
60003290 The countryside ninja of Ashina was caught with me.
60003300 Lie, Jaro ... this ... eagle?
60003400 Hirata mansion was surprisingly easy
60003401 Isn&#39;t the owl&#39;s guide quite good?
60003402 ... I don&#39;t like it
60003403 That old man has a bad smell
60003404 Gubig Big Bit ... Puhaa ...
60003405 That&#39;s the outer road ... It&#39;s the outer road, Masatsugu-san ...
60003406 Well, be patient
60003407 No matter how you plan
60003408 There is nothing I can do ...
60003409 Gee Ep
60003410 Kee ... I wouldn&#39;t complain if I could get some money and sake.
60003500 ... I will borrow it
60003501 Watching me ...
60003502 In this battle, our reeds will definitely ...
60003590 … Isshin-sama, borrowed, returned
60003591 Isshin-sama ... Watching me ...
60003600 … Did you slash everything?
60003601 Okay…
60003602 Alright ... I&#39;ll start when Genichiro returns.
60003603 … Along with the dragon seed, create a reed name.
60003604 I know ...
65000600 That shinobi at the bottom of the well ...
65000601 I don&#39;t have a cangue in particular, but is it okay?
65000602 It&#39;s not important. No sword, no energy
65000603 He&#39;s just a bummer ...
65000700 ... Apparently, it seems to have calmed down ...
65000701 !! Thieves, I&#39;m still alive!
65000702 What! ?? What about fire cows? What happened to the fire cow! ??
65000800 Everyone, you know
65000801 What is to come is the battle for the survival of Ashina
65000802 Let&#39;s give up our lives for Isshin-sama and the people of Ashina.
65000803 We are the reeds ... Inflexible reeds!
65000804 Ugh!
65000805 Because of the reed name!
65000900 Didn&#39;t you see the Lord?
65000901 I should have escaped around here ...
65000902 Hmm ... What does that look like?
65000903 It&#39;s a black hat! Kurokasa&#39;s little boy!
65000904 Hmm ... But the ones that passed around here aren&#39;t
65000905 Is it a raccoon dog ... Or is it wrong with Mujina or something?
65000906 Hmm ... Already good!
65001000 It seems that a ninja has entered this area, so please look for it.
65001001 I know ... Isn&#39;t it frequent these days?
65001002 Oh, that ’s how close the battle is.
65001003 That&#39;s why you can&#39;t leave it alone ...
65001100 Hmm ... you ...
65001101 Apparently the demon is coming out
65001102 Just right ... I&#39;m gonna take it right!
65001200 … Well, the story is different
65001201 Lord ... why are you alive
65001202 ... Well, if you get rid of it, Tsuji will match.
65001300 Oh, it burns well!
65001301 Oh, the fire-breathing tube is what I often say, it&#39;s perfect for boosting the economy.
65001302 Don&#39;t make a mistake. It&#39;s a spicy country mansion, but at least it&#39;s about the end ...
70000000 Gu, Guu ...
70000001 ... the owl&#39;s ... swearing ...
70000100 I&#39;m a dog breeder ...
70000101 If you don&#39;t run out of shuriken, you can skewer it
70000300 Gu, Guu ...
70000301 The gun fort in the fall valley ... more than rumors ...
70000302 I wasn&#39;t prepared ... I was reckless ...
70000303 Nostalgic ... I can hear the bell of Senmineji Temple ...
70001000 What happened
70001001 Thieves ... Children ... In Hirata Mansion ...
70001002 Your child ... Hurry up, then ...
70001003 Gu, Guu ...
70001050 What happened
70001051 Thieves ... Children ... In Hirata Mansion ...
70001052 Your child ... Hurry up, then ...
70001100 ... how many years now
70001101 What ... weird ...

70001103 It&#39;s the year of the Ryusen pilgrimage ...
70001104 Gu, Guu ...
70001105 At Ryusen pilgrimage ...
70001106 Three years ago ...
70001107 What does it mean…

70001109 (I don&#39;t remember anything ...)
70001110 (Is this the past ...)

70050002 Is it a French enemy?
70050003 That&#39;s right ... Goho, Goho ... That&#39;s in the abandoned temple in the future ...
70050004 To deceive the villagers ... The village is closed by a phantom fog.
70050005 Is it an abandoned temple ...
70050006 Oh, it&#39;s an old building ...
70050007 Even if the door is closed, there should be a hole on the second floor
70050100 … No, Lord, can you defeat the Buddha&#39;s enemies?
70050101 Goho, goho ...
70050102 That abandoned temple is an old building ...

90000021 Is it a story that autumn leaves are still in full bloom at the bottom of the valley behind the castle?
